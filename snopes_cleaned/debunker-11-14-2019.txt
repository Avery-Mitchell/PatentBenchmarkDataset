“Centrifugal birthing” is not a thing in 2019 (so far as we know), but according to the internet, a device was patented in 1965 that supposedly uses the “gentle” aid of centrifugal force to help modern, “civilized” women with underdeveloped muscles to give birth.

We hear you scoffing (we did too!), but Snopes reporter Bethania Palma dug up the U.S. government patent granted 54 years ago to New Yorkers George and Charlotte Blonsky and tells us it’s the real deal.

(Fair warning, the schematic drawing of this contraption isn’t for the faint of heart!)
