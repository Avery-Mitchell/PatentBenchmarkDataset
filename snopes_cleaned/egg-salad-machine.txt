About this rating

An image of a so-called " egg salad machine " — and a man eating a heaping portion of its product — was shared across social media in late 2024, suggesting the genuine existence of the device.

One post shared to Facebook claimed that it was a photo taken in 1977. Another poster, who shared the image to an arcade forum, said that they would "travel to the lower 48 in search of it!"

Snopes found that the image was first posted to Facebook on Aug. 24, 2024, to the page, "White People Making White People Food." The page is self-described as a "Satire/Parody - Entertainment website."

There are indications that the image was created using artificial intelligence. For example, a closer look at the wood paneling on the wall showed that the panel sizes are not uniform — AI often has a difficult time producing repeating patterns. On the far right, the wood paneling also appears warped where the edge of the machine meets the wall.

AI also has a difficult time with lettering, and one of the words on the lower half of the machine is misspelled reading, "EGGG."
