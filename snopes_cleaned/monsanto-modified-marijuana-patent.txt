On 9 April 2015, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) website reported that the agribusiness giant Monsanto company had patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana:

Monsanto, the multi-billion agribusiness giant, has announced today it has patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana.

The news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture business alike as a move forward towards the industrial use of marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the U.S.A. and ultimately, to the world.

Although Monsanto’s testing on cannabis is only at an experimental stage, no plan has yet been released by the agriculture business firm as to what purposes the patented strain would be used for, although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill which could “loosen up laws around medical marijuana” is reportedly scheduled to pass before congress coming this fall.

This article was not true. Monsanto has made no such announcement, and the photograph accompanying the article's fabricated quotes attributed to "James Adamson, president of Medical Marijuana Technologies" was actually a stolen picture of Bob Buckingham , a Newfoundland lawyer:
