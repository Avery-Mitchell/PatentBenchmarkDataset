    "claim": "Actor Terrence Howard holds a patent on augmented and virtual reality technology.",
    "author": "Nikki Dobrin",
    "date_published": "2024-05-31",
    "summary": "Terrence Howard claimed on a podcast that he holds multiple patents, including the first for AR/VR. While he did file a patent application in 2010, it was abandoned in 2013 due to a failure to respond to the USPTO. Therefore, he was never granted a patent for the technology.",
    "evidence": [
      "Howard filed patent application US12/765,485 in 2010 titled 'World of Windows' related to AR/VR tech.",
      "The patent application was abandoned in 2013 due to failure to respond to an office action.",
      "USPTO records confirm Howard never received a granted patent number for this application.",
      "On 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' Howard said his agents kept charging him fees which led him to abandon the application.",
      "Howard claimed that companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Amazon cited his patent, but citation does not imply use or endorsement.",
      "Citations in patent filings do not mean the technology was usedâ€”just considered as prior art."
