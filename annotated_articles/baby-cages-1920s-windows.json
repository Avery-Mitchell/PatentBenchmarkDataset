    "text": "About this rating\n\nWould you allow your baby to be held in a cage suspended outside your apartment building? That's what families were allegedly doing in the 1920s, when they placed their toddlers in wire-enclosed \"baby cages\" hung outside of windows in order to give children \"proper fresh air.\"\n\nPhotographs and videos of the supposed invention have been shared on social media platforms for years . In late July 2024, we found a fresh post about the claim being shared on X :\n\nWe fact-checked this claim in November 2023 and found the peculiar contraption was indeed real, despite its apparent dangers.\n\nSnopes conducted a keyword search of \"baby cage patent 1922\" and found the invention was genuine. U.S. Patent 1448235 was described as a \"Portable Baby Cage\" and was filed on July 19, 1922, by Emma Read, a self-described resident of Spokane, Washington, at the time.\n\nThe patent was approved on March 13, 1923, and expired on the same day in 1940. It read, in part:\n\nIt is well known that a great many difficulties arise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint. This is especially true with reference to babies and young children, who at present are being raised in large apartments, as a result of not obtaining the proper fresh air, as well as being outdoors, for such air and exercise.\n\nIn crowded cities, where the houses are closely arranged, and in large apartments, there is no way for proper ventilation. Back and front yards are small, while those living in apartments have no facilities whatever, to permit the children and babies to receive proper fresh air from the outside.\n\nWith these facts in view, it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed. This article of manufacture comprises a housing or cage, wherein the baby or young child together with proper toys may be placed. The baby is enabled to receive fresh air through the screen or wire fabric, and it will be noted that the baby has sufficient room or space for playing with toys…\n\nThe description goes on to explain that \"suitable bed clothing\" may also be arranged in the cage to allow for proper napping facilities made up with \"suitable curtains.\"\n\nThe figures below also accompanied the patent , which provided dimensions and construction information for the cage.\n\n(Google Patents)\n\nSnopes has a history of investigating the origins of what appear to be bizarre inventions of the past, including a device that enabled its user to smoke an entire pack of 20 cigarettes at once and plastic cone-shaped face masks to supposedly protect people against snowstorms."
