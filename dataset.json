Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nOn March 9, 2020, on a website promoting his health coaching and personal development business, Christian Elliot published a piece in which he stated \"that the whole media frenzy about the Coronavirus is a bunch of money-making hype.\" One year and just under 3 million coronavirus deaths later, Elliot — a self-described \"natural health nerd\" who does not believe in germ theory — is back with more thoughts on the pandemic in a mega-viral article titled \"18 Reasons I Won't Be Getting a Covid Vaccine.\"\n\nNearly all of the 18 reasons provided by Elliot are scientifically incorrect, overt misrepresentations, or irrelevant to the safety of COVID-19 vaccines . The post repeatedly pushes the false notion that COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent death , infection , and transmission . In several cases, Elliot misunderstands or misrepresents completely the data he cites to support his reasoning.\n\nThe ideas presented in the piece are not original, either. Virtually all of the claims in Elliot's article, when not years' old anti-vaccine tropes, can be tied to the most prominent anti-vaccine activists, contrarians, conspiracy theorists, or snake-oil salesmen of the COVID-19 era, including Sherri Tenpenny , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Geert Vanden Bossche , Alex Berenson , and Joseph Mercola .\n\nIn this article, Snopes dissects, point by point, each of Elliot's \"reasons\" for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n#1 \"Vaccine Makers Are Immune from Liability\"\n\nThe first point on Elliot's list falls into the years' old anti-vaccine trope category.\n\nIt is true that vaccine manufacturers are shielded from liability. Without this liability protection, vaccine manufacturers were unwilling to supply the government with vaccines. As part of a 1986 compromise , the United States created legal protections for vaccine manufacturers while also establishing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a federal claims court that settles cases of alleged vaccine injury. As explained in Science, \"The VICP was established after lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates.\"\n\nWhile invoking this liability protection is a common anti-vaccine tactic, it is not a specific or novel argument unique to COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines including the ones that have been required by schools for decades fall into this category.\n\n#2 \"The Checkered Past of the Vaccine Companies\"\n\nPharmaceutical companies, including some involved in COVID-19 vaccine production, have indeed been fined billions of dollars in damages or criminal fines. Elliot asks \"Given the free pass from liability, and the checkered past of these companies, why would we assume that all their vaccines are safe and made completely above board?\"\n\nElliot's framing falsely suggests that the only check on vaccine safety derives from the word of the manufacturer. But all vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, have all passed through phase I, phase II, and phase III trials, and these data are analyzed by both academics and government health officials. The process is not a rubber stamp of approval. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found problems in the way AstraZeneca presented its data to regulators, for example, and the agency has yet to approve the vaccine for use in the United States.\n\nElliot states that neither Moderna nor Johnson & Johnson had ever brought a vaccine to market before COVID-19. While true, neither company is inexperienced in vaccine development. Johnson & Johnson received long-awaited approval from the European Commission for a vaccine against Ebola in July 2020. Moderna has been at the forefront of developing the mRNA technology used in both its vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna and the U.S. government had already entered into a licensing agreement for this technology before the global COVID-19 pandemic was declared.\n\nAlthough off topic, Elliot asserts in this section of the post that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \"contains tissues from aborted fetal cells.\" This is false. As Snopes explained in March 2021, embryonic stem cells are used in the production of the vaccine, the shot itself contains no material derived from fetal cells.\n\n#3 \"The Ugly History of Attempts to Make Coronavirus Vaccines\"\n\nThe first attempted scientific assertion about COVID-19 vaccines presented by Elliot at this point is where things really get off the rails. The purported \"ugly history\" of coronavirus vaccine research stems largely from a factually deficient telling of events pushed by anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny. Snopes debunked her claims in detail in March 2021.\n\nAbout four months ago, Tenpenny began making the claim that COVID-19 vaccines would begin to wreak \"havoc on the lungs\" in \"four to 14 months.\" Her argument relied on the studies of SARS and MERS vaccines later cited in Elliot's post. The rhetorical trick employed by Tenpenny, who charges hundreds of dollars for her \"Mastering Vaccine Info Boot Camp\" class, is to highlight older studies describing scientific challenges identified over the past decade of coronavirus vaccine development and ignore the studies that show how they overcome these challenges.\n\nThese challenges concerned two types of negative outcomes observed in some trials of previous SARS and MERS vaccine candidates that researchers feared could also happen in COVID-19 vaccines. The first was the possibility that the vaccine could actually increase the susceptibility of cells to be infected through a process known as vaccine induced enhancement, or antibody-dependent enhancement. The second was that exposure to COVID-19 following vaccination could send your immune system into overdrive and destroy the lungs — an injury termed immunopathology .\n\nSubsequent study on coronavirus vaccine research — ignored by both Tenpenny and Elliot —  led scientists to understand that this suite of reactions, broadly speaking, would occur in vaccines that failed to do two things: first, generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies (in the case of vaccine-enhanced disease) and, second, produce an immune response dominated by what are called Th-1 cells as opposed to Th-2 cells (in the case of immunopathology). For this reason, researchers knew at the very start of the pandemic to focus their efforts on technology that produced neutralizing antibodies and avoided the production of Th-2 cells. The mRNA vaccine technology provides the ability to generate such a response.\n\nAn October 2020 report in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that “The mRNA-1273 vaccine [i.e Moderna] induced [Th1] biased … responses and low or undetectable Th2 … responses.” As reported in Nature, data from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine indicate a “TH1-biased response.” These, along with the 192,282,781 doses administered in the United States alone, are quite literally the data necessary \"to suggest they overcame that pesky problem of Vaccine Enhanced Disease.\"\n\nIt bears mentioning that the \"cytokine storm\" described by Elliot, in which overzealous pro-inflammatory immune cells attack healthy tissue, is a characteristic of a Th-2-biased response. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, itself produces a strong Th-2 response — severe cases of COVID-19 are often characterized by cytokine storms. A good way to head off such a response is to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n#4 \"The 'Data Gaps' Submitted to the FDA by the Vaccine Makers\"\n\nElliot focuses extensively on what the FDA identified as \"data gaps\" in the approval reports for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to suggest the vaccines do not prevent transmission or mortality of COVID-19. However, these reports , published in December 2020, contain no data collected after November 2020. Writing in April 2021, Elliot ignores the data that includes the hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine that have since been administered. These data are providing more definitive answers to those questions. As described in an April 2021 feature in The Atlantic:\n\nThe vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson seem to provide stronger and more lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants than natural infection. They are excellent at reducing symptomatic infection . Even better, they are extraordinarily successful at preventing severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nCountries that have vaccinated large percentages of their population quickly, such as the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Israel, have all seen sharp and sustained declines in hospitalizations among the elderly. Meanwhile, countries that have lagged in the vaccination effort—including the U.K.’s neighbors France and Italy, and Israel’s neighbor Jordan—have struggled to contain the virus.\n\n#5: \"No Access to the Raw Data from the Trials\"\n\nWhile the \"raw data\" from clinical trials is not widely available, data from the clinical trials referenced by Elliot along with their entire experimental protocols can be found in these two journal publications . Further, as described in the medical journal BMJ, \"around 400 pages of summary data are available in the form of multiple reports presented by and to the FDA prior to the agency’s emergency authorization of each company’s mRNA vaccine.\"\n\nRegardless, Elliot primarily uses this section of his post as a platform to grossly misinterpret how COVID-19 trials are conducted. Citing a BMJ editorial , Elliot noted that, in a Pfizer trial, \"3,410 total cases of suspected, but unconfirmed covid-19 in the overall study population, 1,594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1,816 in the placebo group.” Elliot falsely interprets this statement to mean that some people in the trial were not actually tested for COVID-19:\n\nDid they fail to do science in their scientific study by not verifying a major variable?\n\nCould they not test those \"suspected but unconfirmed\" cases to find out if they had covid? Apparently not.\n\nWhy not test all 3,410 participants for the sake of accuracy?\n\nThe answer to these three questions, respectively, is \"no,\" \"they did,\" and \"they did.\"\n\nThe faulty interpretation of data repeated by Elliot was popularized by Alex Berenson — described in The Atlantic as \"The Pandemic’s Wrongest Man.\" As Kawsar Talaat, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, explained in that story:\n\n\"Suspected but unconfirmed\" refers to \"people who call in and say, 'I have a runny nose.' So we mark them as ‘suspected.’ Then we ask them to take a PCR test, and we test their swab, and if the test comes back negative, the FDA says it’s \"unconfirmed.\"\n\n#6: \"No Long-Term Safety Testing\"\n\nIt is necessarily true that the world lacks long-term data on vaccines that are less than a year old. We also lack long-term data on the disease for which the vaccines are designed to stop, but what little data we do have suggests the possibility of long and lasting effects in severe cases of COVID-19. Elliot implores his readers to wait until \"those pesky data gaps\" have been filled, but as described above, many of those gaps are already filled at this point.\n\n#7: \"No Informed Consent\"\n\nContrary to the assertions made in this blog post, COVID-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization in the U.S. have completed phase three trials —  or at least an interim analysis of a phase three trial — before being approved . It is not true , as claimed in the post, that any person given a COVID-19 vaccine is part of a clinical trial.\n\nElliot implies that the FDA is hiding, or would hide, the harmful effects of vaccines from the public. \"If the vaccines are causing harm,\" he opined, \"wouldn't we be seeing that all over the news? Surely the FDA would step in and pause the distribution?\" At the time of this reporting, the biggest news in the COVID-19 vaccine space is that the FDA paused the distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in response to six blood clotting cases out of nearly 7 million doses administered.\n\n#8: \"Under-Reporting of Adverse Reactions and Death\"\n\nThis point — the claim that adverse reactions to vaccines are under-reported —  is another example of a years' old anti-vaccine trope. Here, the assertion is repurposed to imply that the number of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines reported to the National Vaccine Adverse Events Reports System (VAERS), a federally run program designed to monitor vaccine safety, is likely massively undercounted.\n\nElliot asserts that these reports show that there have been \"over 2,200 deaths from the current COVID vaccines, as well as close to 60,000 adverse reactions.\" VAERS is a self-reported system that in no way determines the cause of death or association with a vaccine. Just because someone died several months after they got a vaccine does not mean , as often claimed by activists, that a vaccine caused that death.\n\nUsing something purported to be a \"Harvard study\" (but that is actually a grant report on a project that could not be completed), Elliot performed some truly outrageous back-of-the-envelope math based on that report's claim that VAERS only captures 1% percent of total incidents:\n\nIf those numbers are still only 1% of the total adverse reactions ... you can do the math, but that equates to somewhere around 110,000 to 220,000 deaths from the vaccines to date, and a ridiculous number of adverse reactions.\n\nWith respect to the 1% figure, extrapolating it to cases of death rests on the false assumption that reporting rates for all adverse events, regardless of severity, are the same. As a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Reuters , reporting rates for different types of adverse events vary:\n\nMild events, like a rash, tend to be reported less frequently than severe events (like a seizure). We have data to show that serious adverse events that occur after vaccination are more likely to be reported than non-serious adverse events. Events such as a sore arm at the injection site might not get reported since they are expected and therefore people don’t feel the need to report them.\n\nIf your mathematical analysis leads you to claim that there have been 220,000 vaccine caused deaths that have somehow flown under the radar in a climate where six blood clotting incidents paused the distribution of a vaccine, it might make sense to challenge the assumptions that brought you to that \"ridiculous number\" in the first place.\n\n#9: \"The Vaccines Do Not Stop Transmission or Infection\"\n\nElliot again repeats the false assertion that vaccines do not stop viral transmission or infection. The post asks  \"If we're worried about asymptomatic spreaders, would the vaccine not make it more likely that we are creating asymptomatic spread?\" No, the empirical data on this point is clear: The vaccines reduce asymptomatic transmission . \"If it indeed reduces symptoms, anyone who gets it might not even know they are sick and thus they are more likely to spread the virus, right?\" Again, no, because the vaccine reduces asymptomatic spread and viral load .\n\n#10: \"People Are Catching COVID After Being Fully Vaccinated\"\n\nSome people have caught COVID-19 after being vaccinated. This is not unexpected. When vaccine manufacturers say their product is, for example, 95% effective, that means it will be not effective in 5% of cases. When you have administered over 100 million doses of vaccine, you are going to find cases of people for whom the vaccine did not prevent infection. Even in those cases, however, it is likely that the vaccine still helps to reduce the severity of infection .\n\n#11: \"The Overall Death Rate from COVID\"\n\nElliot asserts that COVID-19 has a \"99.74%\" survival rate. It is unclear when or where Elliot got this figure, but it was almost certainly not the CDC , as claimed. Determining such a number is challenging for several reasons, and the number can change over time. At the time of this reporting, according to Johns Hopkins University, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 in the United States — the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases — is 1.8%. As Anthony Fauci explained during congressional testimony, even a rate of 1% would make COVID-19 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.\n\n#12: \"The Bloated COVID Death Numbers\"\n\nCOVID-19's death numbers are not \"bloated.\" Once again, Elliot is making an argument rooted in a complete misunderstanding of the data he touts as evidence. In this case, the faulty logic has its origins in a viral claim made by a QAnon twitter account that was retweeted by President Donald Trump in November 2020:\n\nAccording to the CDCs own numbers, (scroll down to the section \"Comorbidities and other conditions\") only 6% of the deaths being attributed to covid are instances where covid seems to be the only issue at hand.\n\nIn other words, reduce the death numbers you see on the news by 94% and you have what is likely the real numbers of deaths from just covid.\n\nThe CDC report Elliot references is a table that shows \"Number of COVID-19 deaths with contributing conditions.\" The table is introduced with the explanation that \"for 6% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned in the death certificate.\" Elliot suggests that these are the only pure COVID-19 deaths because no other cause can be blamed. This is absurd.\n\nThe very conditions listed on this table are, in several cases, those that are commonly produced by COVID-19, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, and cardiac complications. It is simply a gross misuse of this data to suggest that people who are listed as dying of respiratory failure and COVID-19, for example, are not legitimate COVID-19 deaths. As explained in an October 2020 Scientific American article , the records included in that 6% are mostly likely the result of incomplete reports:\n\nThose death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, [Robert] Anderson, [chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics] says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus. The idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false.\n\nThere are, as well, methods to calculate death tolls that are wholly unreliant on cause of death: one is a figure known as excess mortality. In simple terms, the figure compares the number of people expected to die during a given time period to the number of people who actually died during that time period. These data reveal that the U.S. is experiencing an unprecedented period of mortality that far exceeds the background level expected by the seasonal flu.\n\nIn the figure below, each bar represents the total number of deaths that occurred every week in the United States from January 2017 to the present, regardless of cause. The most recent weeks are undercounts due to the time it takes for the data to be reported. The yellow bar represents the expected number of deaths for that week. Any bar with a red cross at the top represents a week in which deaths were higher than would be expected:\n\n#13: \"Fauci and Six Others at NIAID Own Patents in the Moderna Vaccine\"\n\nThis is not correct and it also isn't a critique of vaccine safety. It is, instead, an appeal to emotion that invokes the specter of Fauci, a boogeyman to the anti-vaccine/COVID-19 denial movement, to sow paranoia about ulterior motives.\n\nThe post asserts that \"Tony Fauci owns over 1,000 patents … including patents being used on the Moderna vaccine.\" Elliot lifts this false notion from an interview between Naomi Wolf and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. Kennedy, whose Instagram page spreading unhinged claims about 5G wireless technology, Bill Gates, and microchips, was banned in February 2021, is one of the most prolific spreaders of disinformation surrounding vaccine safety, and Ellliot cites Kennedy's Children's Defense Fund organization several times in his post.\n\nFauci is listed as an inventor on at least 36 patents or patent applications, according to a Google Patents search. Being an inventor does not mean that an individual \"owns\" the patent. These patents are owned primarily by the United States government or, in some cases, the academic institutions where most of the research was conducted. More to the point, however, Fauci himself does not own any patent related to any COVID-19 vaccine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) does claim joint-ownership of the Moderna vaccine, and Fauci is director of the institute within the NIH that deals with vaccines. Prior to COVID-19 being declared a pandemic disease, in December 2019, the NIH had already signed a contract with Moderna to research coronavirus vaccines. As reported by Axios:\n\nNIH and Moderna have researched coronaviruses, like MERS, for several years, and signed a contract this past December that stated \"mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates [are] developed and jointly owned\" by the two parties. The contract was not specific to the novel coronavirus, and it was signed before the new virus had been sequenced .\n\nModerna had been, for years, developing the vaccine technology that allows for the delivery of mRNA to cells to produce custom-designed antibodies. When the pandemic struck, researchers at NIH sequenced, designed, and applied for a patent on the mRNA sequence that codes for the spike protein found in SARS-CoV-2. This genetic code is what is delivered by Moderna's technology.\n\nAs a result of that fact and the contract signed in December, NIH claims joint ownership of that vaccine. This is not done to enrich individual scientists in the U.S. government, but to allow for a \"non-exclusive licensing approach for these patent rights in order to allow multiple vaccine developers\" to produce COVID-19 vaccines. Both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson use the NIH patented spike protein code as well .\n\nThe assertion that Fauci profits from the Moderna vaccine is false because Fauci doesn't \"own\" any relevant patent related to COVID-19 vaccine technology.\n\n#14: \"Fauci Is on the Hot Seat for Illegal Gain-Of-Function Research\"\n\nThe post continues to veer off topic with more Fauci clickbait that heavily implies that the disease whose risks Elliot spent this whole post minimizing is also, maybe, actually, a genetically engineered supervirus:\n\nWhat is \"Gain-of-Function\" research? It's where scientists attempt to make viruses gain functions--i.e. make them more transmissible and deadlier.\n\nSounds at least a touch unethical, right? How could that possibly be helpful? Our government agreed, and banned the practice.\n\nSo what did the Fauci-led NIAID do? They pivoted and outsourced the gain-of-function research (in coronaviruses no less) to China--to the tune of a $600K grant. Mr. Fauci, you have some explaining to do...and I hope the cameras are recording when you have to defend your actions.\n\nThe controversy over a $600K grant by the NIH to a New York Based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance that partners with the Wuhan Institute of Virology was popular early on in the pandemic, when people like Joseph Mercola — who has been fined millions of dollars over claims that tanning beds sold by his company would \"slash your risk of cancer\" — attempted to push the unsupported claim that COVID-19 was a bioweapon.\n\nThe $600K grant, which Fauci had no direct oversight over, was an extension of an existing grant that had been funded since 2014 . The \"illegal\" gain of function research alleged to have been conducted through this grant was initiated before the U.S. imposed a pause on \"Selected Gain-of-Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS and SARS Viruses.\" None of these conspiratorial diversions, however, hold any relevance to COVID-19 vaccine safety.\n\n#15: \"The Virus Continues to Mutate\"\n\nEarlier in his post, Elliot said he didn't trust Fauci because \"he hasn't treated one covid patient\" and because he allegedly had a financial interest in vaccine technology. It is odd, then, that his article places so much faith in Geert Vanden Bossche, a veterinarian who has spent the past decade trying and failing to patent something he calls a \"universal vaccine\" capable of killing a wide variety of diseases. His assertions, Snopes reported in March 2021, are part of a thinly veiled campaign to get people to pay more attention to an invention he tried and failed to patent at least twice.\n\nIn a series of viral posts published to his personal website in March 2020, Vanden Bossche argued that the current COVID-19 vaccines, through a mechanism analogous to antibiotic resistance, will create mutant variants of the virus that escape the protection of those vaccines. The only solution, he says, is his universal vaccine.\n\nViruses do mutate — this is not a surprise or a breaking news story. In places where his argument wasn't completely speculative, Vanden Bossche relied heavily on the notion that vaccines are unable to prevent asymptomatic transmission. This is an increasingly untenable position to argue, and pausing all vaccination, as Vanden Bossche advocates, will simply increase the rate and number of mutations occurring.\n\n#16: \"Censorship ... and the Complete Absence of Scientific Debate\"\n\nIt is hard to take seriously allegations of \"censorship\" from someone whose blog post has been viewed over 2 million times and shared over a hundred thousand times on Facebook. There has been robust debate over myriad aspects of the pandemic including the reality of airborne transmission , the utility of lockdowns , how vaccine clinical trials are run , for example.\n\nIt is not censorship to point out that, for example, \"suspected but unconfirmed\" does not refer to people assumed to have COVID who have not been tested for it. It is not censorship to point out that claims of massive lung damage caused by vaccines stem from an argument from an activist who ignores all vaccine research conducted since the pandemic started. It is not censorship to point out that a back-of-the-envelope calculation asserting 220,000 vaccine-caused deaths relies on a series of massively untenable assumptions. And it is not censorship to report on the fact that COVID-19 causes death through the very same comorbidities that Elliot asserts are \"bloating\" the death toll.\n\n#17: \"The World's Leading Vaccinologist Is Sounding the Alarm…\"\n\nVanden Bossche is not \"the world's leading vaccinologist.\" As reported by McGill University's Office for Science and Society, \"His academic publications essentially stop in 1995, except for one 2017 article about his … vaccine idea published in a journal belonging to a publishing group, OMICS Group Inc, that has been called “predatory” and was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive practices.\"\n\nHe does hold a Ph.D. in virology, and he has worked on vaccine development at several institutions. His ideas, as described above, are motivated by a belief that his invention, and his invention alone, can stop the pandemic, despite the fact that it does not exist. It is a speculative argument rejected by actual top vaccinologists.\n\nThe solution to that risk of COVID-19 variants is not to halt vaccination, as Vanden Bossche would like, but to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, thereby reducing both transmission of the virus and the number of environments in which mutations could occur. This is what COVID-19 vaccines do, and their widespread use serves to reduce the opportunities for the virus to mutate, and is why rapid vaccination is imperative.\n\n“We’re in a race with the new variants,” Sara Del Valle, a computational epidemiologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, explained in a March 2021 feature in the scientific journal Nature. Waiting for Vanden Bossche’s “universal vaccine,” as we previously reported, is no way to win such a race.\n\n#18: \"I Already Had Covid\"\n\nElliot asserts that he already had COVID-19 and that it wasn't all that bad. He claims that this means he has \"beautiful, natural, life-long immunity\" — an assertion based on eight months of data that does not speak to lifelong immunity. In other words, he is not going to get the vaccine because he, personally, survived unscathed and believes there remains no risk to himself.\n\nBut the vaccine hesitancy potentially inspired by these largely incorrect ideas increases the risk to everyone, including people not blessed, like Elliot, with an immune system capable of beating COVID-19. Vaccines are not only about protecting an individual, but about reducing the spread of a disease and environments in which viral mutations can occur.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe ultimate fallacy of this post is best expressed by a question posed by Elliot. \"Why,\" he asked, \"given that natural immunity has never ultimately failed humanity, do we suddenly not trust it?\" Here's the thing — by asserting that natural immunity has \"never ultimately failed humanity,\" Elliot appears to be setting the bar for a \"real\" public health emergency somewhere in the vicinity of the total extinction of our species.\n\nElliot is correct that humanity still exists despite several pandemics in the past. Such a framing of the problem betrays a truly breath-taking disregard for actual human life. The Plague of Justinian beginning in 165 A.D. killed an estimated 30 to 50 million people. The Black Death in the 1300s killed between 75 and 200 million people. When smallpox was introduced to the New World in the 1500s, some 25 to 55 million people were killed. The 1918 flu caused around 50 million deaths. Natural immunity quite literally failed these people.\n\nThanks to modern medicine, however, humanity is no longer forced to reckon with pandemic disease using only our \"natural immunity.\" COVID-19 vaccines reduce death , infection , and transmission . Using a series of debunked falsehoods, Elliot argues that they don't and — further — that COVID-19 is not dangerous. As Saad Omer , an epidemiologist who serves as director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us earlier in a phone interview about claims made by Vanden Bossche, “The underlying fallacy is that a natural infection is better than a vaccine.\""

      "article_title": "Authentic 1923 Picture of Men Demonstrating Bulletproof Vest?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nA black-and-white photograph shared online as early as 2009 claims to show the demonstration of an early bulletproof vest in 1923. In the photograph, two men are seen facing each other, one in a vest with his hands behind his back. The other man is holding a gun that appears to have just been fired.\n\nThe photo has been shared on various social media platforms, including Facebook , Pinterest , X and Instagram , including the below post that was shared on March 25, 2024:\n\nIn short, we've rated this claim as \"True\" because reputable sources confirm that it is authentic.\n\nSnopes determined through a reverse image search that the Library of Congress hosts the photograph and describes the testing of a \"bulletproof vest\" on Sept. 13, 1923. Specifically, the photo is found in The National Photo Company Collection collection, which documents \"virtually all aspects of Washington, D.C., life\" between 1850 and 1945. Another image also documented as having been taken on the same day is shown below:\n\n(Library of Congress/Public Domain)\n\nThe National Law Enforcement posted a colorized version of the photograph to its Facebook page on July 18, 2022, with a caption that read:\n\nThe gentlemen are pictured showcasing the invention to the Washington Metropolitan Police Dept. in an \"effort to prove the vests could protect officers.\"\n\nAccording to Atlas Obscura , the photo shows W.H. Murphy of the Protective Garment Corp. \"demonstrating his wares to a Maryland deputy sheriff.\" Rare Historical Photos, a blog that posts historical photos, wrote that the \"live demonstration took place at the Washington City police headquarters.\" The blog added:\n\nThe police officers in the background (in the second photo) are all part of the Frederick County Police Department, the gun they are firing is believed to be an S&W Model 10 Revolver. Mr. Murphy stood less than ten feet (3 m) from the firing gun and took two consecutive .38 round slugs straight to the chest, and eyewitnesses claim he \"didn't bat an eye\" in both cases.\n\nLater Murphy gave the deflected .38 bullet to the police officer as a souvenir. This vest weighed 11 lb (5.0 kg), fit close to the body, and was considered more comfortable than the previous types of bulletproof vests.\n\nSnopes did not find another source to validate the details published by Atlas Obscura and Rare Historical Photos but contacted the Library of Congress for further information.

      "article_title": "Is this vintage ad for whiskey toothpaste real? We're not sure — but the product is",
      "text": "Since late 2024 , social media users have spread a supposedly real vintage advertisement for scotch- and bourbon-flavored toothpaste.\n\nThe image of the ad spread on Reddit , Facebook and X . It read: \"SPIKED TOOTHPASTE — SCOTCH OR BOURBON FLAVORED…Put some 'spirit' in your brushing! Real, honest to goodness whiskey in toothpaste.\" The allegedly authentic ad also joked that the toothpaste will get men to brush their teeth \"3, 4, even 5 times daily.\" Some internet users said the ad brought to mind pop star Kesha's 2009 song \"TiK ToK,\" which includes a lyric about the singer brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel's whiskey.\n\nAccording to many of these posts, a man named Don Poynter invented the product in the 1950s.\n\nAlthough it was unclear whether this particular advertisement was authentic, whiskey-flavored toothpaste was, in fact, a real product sold to consumers. Poynter, a novelty inventor from Cincinnati, Ohio, is widely credited with creating the product in the mid-1950s — but there is some evidence boozy toothpaste existed even earlier.\n\nHave more information on this topic? Send us a tip .\n\nThe history of whiskey toothpaste\n\nSnopes could not find proof that the specific advertisement shown above appeared in vintage newspapers. Neither could Cincinnati Public Library researcher Jessie Ludwig, who said via email she could not find the exact ad referenced in the claims — but \"it is safe to say that it was a real product.\"\n\nThat's because advertisements marketing whiskey-flavored toothpaste as a novelty gift item appeared in a wide variety of newspapers in the mid-1950s. \"Taste it! Smell it! There's real whiskey in this toothpaste!\" proclaimed one 1955 Cincinnati Enquirer ad selling the toothpaste for $1.50 a tube.\n\nAnother authentic ad that appeared in the Austin American-Statesman in 1956 used a similar tagline to that of the purported ad : \"A sure way to make him brush his teeth three, four, or even five times a day!\" the real ad , available on historical archive Newspapers.com , said. \"Cleans teeth, too!\"\n\nAn authentic ad for whiskey toothpaste in the June 15, 1956, issue of the Austin American-Statesman. (Newspapers.com)\n\nMany of the ads said the tubes came in three flavors — bourbon, scotch and rye — and were \"6 proof,\" meaning they contained 3% alcohol by volume. The product became popular enough, in fact, that an Iowa state representative reportedly tried to ban it.\n\nPoynter launched his version of the product \"around 1954,\" per an interview with the University of Cincinnati's UC Magazine, but the earliest mention of \"whiskey toothpaste\" we found comes from a story printed in at least three newspapers in 1937. In all three instances , the story described an incident in which a local health officer tracked down a salesman who was allegedly selling whiskey-flavored toothpaste to children in Burbank, California.\n\nA public patent search returned no results for a whiskey-flavored toothpaste patent owned by Poynter, although it did return patents on various other novelty items he created.\n\nStill, it is clear Poynter popularized the product; a search of Newspapers.com found no additional stories or advertisements about whiskey toothpaste until the 1950s. Numerous articles from around that era credited Poynter with the invention, including papers from Pennsylvania , Maryland and Massachusetts .\n\nLife magazine even published a story on the boozy tubes in 1955. Although the text of the article did not appear to be available online, images from the story are available in Life's photo collection .\n\nThe Cincinnati Museum Center reportedly has some of Poynter's whiskey toothpaste, as does at least one private collector: Guinness World Records, in 2023, determined that an American dentist holds the world's largest toothpaste collection — and that his favorite tubes are \" a set of three whisky-flavoured ones (rye, scotch, and bourbon), manufactured by Don Poynter in the 1950s.\"\n\nPoynter died in 2021 at age 96. His obituary in The Wall Street Journal called whiskey-flavored toothpaste \"one of his best ideas.\""

      "article_title": "Apple to Block iPhone Cameras at Concerts?",
      "text": "At the end of June 2016, apple won approval from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a patent (originally filed in 2011) covering a technology to use infrared signals to send encoded data to cell phones via their cameras.\n\nApple has announced no plans to deploy this technology in iPhones, nor what use they might put it to if they did, but news reports quickly seized on the idea that it could (and would) be used to prevent the taking of photographs and videos at live performances:\n\nThe new software, which hasn’t been officially introduced by Apple, would reportedly allow venues to use an infrared beam to disable a mobile phone’s camera, preventing users from taking videos and photos. The development comes as musicians and actors regularly complain about the growing use of mobile phones and selfie sticks at live performances, which allow fans to immediately share content on social media for the millions of people who didn’t actually pay for tickets.\n\nArtists like Adele, Jack White and Zooey Deschanel have publicly expressed frustration with the throng of phones at concerts. Meanwhile, actor Benedict Cumberbatch broke character during a performance of “Hamlet” to tell audience members in London to stop recording him with their phones.\n\n“It’s mortifying and there is nothing less supportive or enjoyable as an actor on stage experiencing that,” the actor said.\n\nBut as others noted, the technology has a wealth of potential applications, everything from providing visitors with information about museum pieces to displaying advertisements to aiding firemen:\n\nWhether it's to distribute ads as you walk by a store, or to display a 3D blueprint of a burning building in a heads-up display worn by a firefighter, big tech companies like Apple are exploring multiple options to more tightly integrate their devices and services with the physical world.\n\nThe patent showed two possible applications. The first is an infrared emitter placed near an object in a museum (Apple's example is an Aztec Water Jug). If you point the phone camera at the object, it receives an infrared signal instructing the cell phone to give the user additional information about the jug.\n\nIt is true the technology could potentially be used to disable cell phone cameras at live performances, but it could also be used to supplement that activity or turn it into a form of partnership that benefits both the audience and the performer:\n\nApple’s patent, which illustrates how an iPhone would become temporarily disabled during a rock concert, would require an infrared transmitter to be installed at shows.\n\nWhen switched on, the patent says, the phone would simply display a “recording disabled” message when audience members attempt to take photographs or videos. Alternatively, a watermark or blur effect may be applied, to discourage people from sharing them.\n\nFor performers, this technology (if it ever gets developed) could deliver dual benefits, but not without cost. Artists could establish camera-free zones at their performances — and potentially incur the ire of fans who resent the curb on their liberties. Alternatively, they could go the opposite route and encourage fans to use their cameras and, as a result, receive, say a discount for merchandise. Artists also could potentially watermark photos taken at the concert.\n\nAnother possible application for the technology, one feared by civil libertarians, is that could be used by government and law enforcement to prevent citizens documenting mistreatment and oppression — although that may not be an authorized use:\n\n\"On the one hand you can imagine the ability to create a perimeter that can disable a paparazzi zone of influence,\" David Wendell Phillips, said. \"On the other hand, do you have the right to control that within a public area? Does that conflict with the right to film? As a private citizen, I have a right to video the police in a public setting. Does a police officer have the right to restrict my ability to film him?\"\n\nAs these dicey questions of civil liberties arise, Apple is unlikely to commercialize its camera-blocking patent, said [digital music consultant Jon] Maples.\n\n\"We all saw how ferociously they went after the government for unlocking an iPhone,\" he said. \"I can't imagine them now releasing a technology that would block your phone. That really goes against the grain of what Apple stands for. Apple has always been about making technology as easy as simple to use as possible, especially with hardware. They just wouldn't just disable you from the machine that you bought from them.\"\n\nOrdinary cameras (and portable cameras not manufactured or licensed by Apple) would not be affected by this particular blocking technology."

      "article_title": "Brassiere and Otto Titzling",
      "text": "Claim: The brassiere was invented by Otto Titzling.\n\nFALSE\n\nOrigins: The realm of popular wisdom is replete with well-traveled factoids that found their way into our culture via a deliberate hoax or playful leg-pull. Such is the case with the notion that the brassiere was invented by the so appropriately named Otto Titzling.\n\nAccording to an inventive history of the undergarment that is now widely believed, Titzling came to invent the item while living in a New York boardinghouse in 1912. One of his neighbors was a buxom opera singer named Swanhilda Olafson, and the structural engineering problems she presented inspired Titzling\n\nto create a contraption to uphold this lady's ample bosom. In the early 1930s, a French fellow named Phillip de Brassiere began producing a similar undergarment. Titzling sued, but Brassiere won in court, and that is why today we call a lady's frontal uplifter a brassiere instead of a titzling.\n\nIt's a great story, but there's no truth to it. The madness began with a 1971 book by Wallace Reyburn titled Bust-Up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra . Like his 1972 send-up, The Inferior Sex: A Treatise on the Inferiority of Women , Bust-Up was a work of satire. (Reyburn wasn't always a jokester, however. Although his biography of Thomas Crapper has often been dismissed as a hoax, Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper was actually on the up-and-up, if somewhat inaccurate.)\n\nThe brassiere has been around in one form or another at least since Greek women wore a chest binding called a mastodeton or apodesmos while exercising. When to date the invention of the modern brassiere to presents a bit of a problem — it depends upon how one defines the\n\ncontraption.\n\nMetallic constructions that looked like bras and did serve to hold matters rigidly in place were around as early as 1859, as a patent granted to Henry S. Lesher of Brooklyn, NY, shows. However, to think of this monstrosity as a garment would be to equate medieval armor with a leisure suit.\n\nCloser to the concept was Clara P. Clark's 1874 \"improved corset,\" a fabric construction that bore a resemblance to today's long-line bra. The fundamental element of her design was the pattern for a fabric breast pocket system held up by shoulder straps that crisscrossed the back.\n\nOlivia P. Flynt's 1876 \"bust supporter\" could possibly be pointed to as the original brassiere provided one accepts shoulder straps that look more like the shoulder yokes of an ordinary blouse. Flynt designed a fabric garment that fit around the upper half of the torso, holding each breast in a fabric pocket supported by shoulder straps. Though the illustration used to support her patent application showed an unadorned garment, written notes accompanying the sketch indicated that the straps could both be made thinner and adorned with lace. She also provided for a double-walled version which permitted the insertion of additional padding to enhance an underdeveloped lady's charms.\n\nCharles Moorehouse came up with an inflatable breast enlarging garment in 1885. It featured air-filled rubber cups that held each breast, and the strapping design is not so far removed from today's undergarments to render his creation unrecognizable as a proto-bra.\n\nMost experts, however, point to 19th-century French feminist Herminie Cadolle as the true inventor of the brassiere and the date of the invention as 1889.\n\nUpon moving to Argentina in the mid-1800s, Cadolle opened a shop selling fancy French underwear. The enterprise flourished, turning Cadolle into a globetrotting businesswoman. Her active lifestyle and busy schedule soon convinced her there just had to be a better foundation garment for women like her than the then-universal and very uncomfortable corset.\n\nIn 1889 she moved back to Paris, there to set up her main shop. She soon after began work on the task of engineering a better undergarment. The top half of her 1889 two-part invention was \"designed to sustain the bosom and supported by the shoulders.\" (The bottom half was a corset that covered only the waist and rear.) Cadolle named this two-piecer le bien-être (the wellbeing).\n\nBy 1905, the two-piecer had become two separate pieces, with the top half coming to be called a soutien-gorge (throat support).\n\nHow and when the modern bra gained the name we now know it by remains unclear. \"Brassiere\" is an ambiguous word to attempt to trace because it was around a long time before anyone thought to use it as the name for a woman's breast-holding undergarment. It had been employed since 17th century by the French, originally meaning a soldier's arm guard or shield. Eventually, it came to mean any kind of upper-body harness with arm straps. By the beginning of the 20th century, \"brassiere\" had come to be synonymous with \"bodice.\" By the 1920s, it had come to identify cupped breast support garments, which is where the word remains today.\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word means \"a woman's undergarment worn to support the breasts.\"\n\nWho connected that word with that meaning, however, is unknown and possibly unknowable. Some say an American named Charles de Bevoise christened it thus in 1902. Others assert that the word turned up in an 1890 issue of Vogue magazine, and others dispute them, saying it didn't appear there until 1907.\n\nBarbara \"bra brawl\" Mikkelson\n\nSightings: Bette Midler sings about Otto Titzling and his wonderful invention in the 1988 movie Beaches and on her 1986 album, \"Mud Will Be Flung Tonight.\" Also, a Trivial Pursuit game card incorrectly gives the inventor of the bra as Otto Titzling.\n\nLast updated: 19 May 2011\n\nSources:\n\nChing, Tee Hun.   \"Mammary Lane.\"\n\nThe [Singapore] Straits Times. 31 December 1999   (Millennium Special; p. 12).\n\nCorrigan, Patricia.   \"A Century Undercover: Looking at the Bra As a Barometer of Society.\"\n\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch. 9 July 1989   (p.

For example, in 2011, the feminist blog Jezebel reported :\n\nThe sole purpose of the \"APPARATUS FOR FACILITATING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD BY CENTRIGUGAL FORCE\" (AFFTBOACBCF, perhaps, for short?) is as such:\n\n\"to provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts.\"\n\nGENTLE?! That contraption looks anything but gentle. And who might this machine be meant for?\n\n\"In the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, as is common with all more primitive peoples, nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case, however, with more civilized women who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement.\"\n\nThe patent for the machine does in fact exist and can be found by searching the website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A patent for the so-called \"Apparatus for Facilitating the Birth of a Child By Centrifugal Force\" was granted to New York residents George and Charlotte Blonsky on Nov. 9, 1965. The purpose of the device was to provide \"gentle\" aid to a woman in giving birth by swirling her around fast enough to create enough force to help propel the baby out.\n\nA rather not-gentle-looking sketch of a nude woman strapped spread-legged into a large piece of machinery accompanied the patent."

      "article_title": "Children Synthesize Two Dollar Version of Martin Shkreli's $750 Malaria Drug",
      "text": "On 30 November 2016, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on a of a class of high school boys from the Sydney Grammar School, who (as part of a collaboration with university scientists) synthesized pyrimethamine, the active ingredient in the drug Daraprim (once used as an antimalarial, now primarily used to treat toxoplasmosis and cystoisosporiasis). Daraprim gained notoriety in September 2015, when Turing Pharmaceuticals (then run by Martin Shkreli) purchased the rights to its distribution and raised its price from $13.50 a tablet to $750.00.\n\nThe Sydney Grammar School story quickly went viral , generally attached to the highly sharable narrative “Sydney schoolboys take down Martin Shkreli, the 'most hated man in the world.'” Shkreli, in series of tweets, lambasted the media for pandering to a feel-good story without looking critically into the facts.\n\nFor background, this project was conceived of by Alice Williamson, a chemist at The University of Sydney and who is part of a group of scientists that goes by the Open Source Malaria consortium. This group describes themselves as “an open source drug discovery project trying to prove that science is better and more efficient when all data and results are shared.”\n\nAn overview of that group’s work can be found in a piece at The Conversation . The group’s driving motivation is to demonstrate the utility of using an open-source, public-data, non-proprietary method to research therapeutic chemicals. In describing the concept of an earlier study they performed, Williamson stated:\n\nThe aim was to enable anyone in the community (from professors and pharmaceutical professionals, to undergraduates and school classes) to help solve our most pressing health concerns. [...]\n\nAnyone could take part, all the data and ideas had to be public domain, and there were to be no patents. Our lab notebooks were no longer sitting on the bench of a locked lab, but were updated in real time on the internet.\n\nIn addition to this group’s scientific work, they also perform outreach and science communication activities (as many grant-funded projects do or are required to do). One such effort was the attempt to make Daraprim with high-school students on the cheap.\n\nBecause Open Source Malaria is committed to their transparency, you can read the entire fascinating thread of this project from concept to completion. Williamson first floated the idea on 8 October 2015:\n\nOne suggestion would be for the students to synthesise Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and some new analogs. This molecule has received a lot of press recently owing to the price hiking over in the USA. Turing pharmaceuticals wanted to raise the price from $13.50 to $750 per dose. Public and media outcry has led the company to reconsider the pricing options but a synthesis in the open would be great to see. Daraprim was originally synthesised as an antimalarial (by Nobel prize winner Gertrude Elion) and is now used in combination with a sulfonamide for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.\n\nThese are the main points of the story that went viral, as excerpted from the Sydney Morning News article:\n\nA handful of year 11 students in Sydney have shown [Shkreli] up, cooking the same drug in their school lab for about $2 a dose. [...]\n\nThe students started with 17 grams of the raw material 2,4-chlorophenyl acetonitrile, also called (4-chlorophenyl)acetonitrile. You can buy it online at $36.50 for 100 grams. [...] From the 17 grams starting material, the boys produced 3.7 grams of pyrimethamine, the chemical name of Daraprim.\n\n\"That's about $US110,000 worth of the drug,\" Dr Williams said, based on the price mark-up of Turing Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn a series of tweets , Shkreli argued that this analysis was misleading. His main objections with the claim were that this research proved it was possible to manufacture the drug for “$2 a dose,” suggesting that that didn’t involve lab equipment or fees, the paid salaries of knowledgeable PhDs and laboratory technicians, and that there was no oversight on the veracity of their results or its purity.\n\nIn terms of claims that the drug — based on the students’ project — could be sold for $2.00, Shkreli makes valid objections. The project (while not a full time effort) lasted roughly a year, and had the input of multiple PhD scientists, all of whom would need to be paid for their work were it not an outreach program. At many points along the way, the manufacture of pyrimethamine required repeated trial and error tests conducted by laboratory technicians.\n\nThe main hurdle, as illuminated by these discussions, was to find a way to get from their starting chemical (2,4-chlorophenyl acetonitrile) to pyramine without exposing the students to significantly dangerous chemicals or conditions. The scientists in this group did a lot of work upfront to brainstorm and test the process in an effort to identify a viable pathway.\n\nFurther, as Shkreli points out, the cost of making a batch of a drug and the cost of bringing a drug to market are very different things. If, for argument’s sake, the students wanted to get their generic version approved in the USA, they would have to subject it to a relatively shorter FDA drug trial called a Abbreviated New Drug Application which, while much less expensive, can still make it unprofitable to bring less commonly used generics to market. That was the the case with Daraprim, and it was the reason Turing Pharmaceuticals was able to hike the price without fear of being undercut.\n\nShkreli’s last point that the trace data were not made available for critique is not fully accurate, as Dr. Williamson did post some of that data online :\n\nNo matter how much help the students had with the design and execution of this project, it is nevertheless an impressive achievement, as it is promoting discussions about the economic and regulatory environment that allow drugs that are (demonstrably) capable of being produced at a low price to be sold with such a high markup.\n\nAs a scientific development, however, the project will do nothing to destroy Turing Pharmaceuticals’ ability to set the price of Daraprim in the United States."

      "article_title": "Did Coca-Cola Ever Contain Cocaine?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe original 19th century Coca-Cola formula had some residual amount of cocaine precursor in it, but that amount was drastically reduced to mere traces by the early 1900s and entirely eliminated by 1930.\n\nWhat we now know as the Coca-Cola soft drink was named back in 1885 for its two \"medicinal\" ingredients: extract of coca leaves and kola nuts. One of the substances commonly produced from the extract of coca leaves is the drug cocaine, a fact which has given rise to the legend that the ubiquitous soft drink Coca-Cola once did (or even still does) include cocaine.\n\nThe short answer to questions about \"cocaine in Coke\" is that Coca-Cola did contain some cocaine (or more specifically, it contained ecgonine, a precursor to cocaine) in its original formulation, but in an amount that's difficult to estimate now given the secrecy that shrouded its formula and manufacturing processes back in the 19th century. Suffice it to say that whatever amount of cocaine was present in Coke was relatively small and not necessarily in a form that would give anyone much of a buzz, the amount was greatly reduced to mere traces around the turn of the century, and it was almost entirely eliminated by 1930.\n\nWhen Coca-Cola entered the scene in the late 19th century, the unregulated medicinal market of the time was flush with patent medicines that included narcotics such as morphine, opium, heroin, and cocaine . A negative public attitude towards these substances was starting to take hold as Coca-Cola's developers (including Asa Candler and Frank M. Robinson) worked on perfecting the formula in 1891, and thus from very early on Coca-Cola's use of coca extract was marginalized:\n\nThe first stirrings of a national debate had begun over the negative aspects of cocaine, and manufacturers were growing defensive over charges that use of their products might lead to \"cocainism\" or the \"cocaine habit\". The full-throated fury against cocaine was still a few years off, and Candler and Robinson were anxious to continue promoting the supposed benefits of the coca leaf, but there was no reason to risk putting more than a tiny bit of coca extract in their syrup. They cut the amount to a mere trace.\n\nHowever, some amount of coca extract was retained as an ingredient in the syrup in order to protect the trade name \"Coca-Cola\":\n\nBut neither could Candler take the simple step of eliminating the fluid extract of coca leaves from the formula. Candler believed that his product's name had to be descriptive, and that he must have at least some by-product of the coca leaf in the syrup (along with some kola) to protect his right to the name Coca-Cola. Protecting the name was critical. Candler had no patent on the syrup itself. Anyone could make an imitation. But no one could put the label \"Coca-Cola\" on an imitation so long as Candler owned the name. The name was the thing of real value, and the registered trademark was its only safeguard. Coca leaves had to stay in the syrup.\n\nHow much cocaine was in that \"mere trace\" is impossible to say, but we do know that by 1902 it was as little as 1/400 of a grain of cocaine per ounce of syrup. Coca-Cola didn't become completely cocaine-free until ecgonine alkaloid extraction was perfected in 1929, but there was scarcely any of the drug left in the drink by then:\n\n[T]he amount of ecgonine [an alkaloid in the coca leaf that could be synthesized to create cocaine] was infinitesimal: no more than one part in 50 million. In an entire year's supply of 25-odd million gallons of Coca-Cola syrup, Heath figured, there might be six-hundredths of an ounce of cocaine.\n\nSo, yes, at one time there was cocaine in Coca-Cola. But before you're tempted to run off claiming Coca-Cola turned generations of drinkers into dope addicts, consider the following: back in 1885 it was far from uncommon to use cocaine in patent medicines (which is what Coca-Cola was originally marketed as) and other medical potions.\n\nWhen it first became general knowledge that cocaine could be harmful, the backroom chemists who comprised Coca-Cola at the time (long before it became the huge company we now know) did everything they could with the technology they had available at the time to remove every trace of cocaine from the beverage. What was left behind (until the technology improved enough for it all to be removed) wasn't enough to give a fly a buzz."

      "article_title": "Henry Ford and Air Conditioning",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThis bit of humor is another well-traveled item that should be easily recognizable as a joke but is nonetheless frequently mailed to us for verification:\n\nExample: [Collected via e-mail, 1993]\n\nIt was a sweltering August day in 1937 when the Cohen brothers entered the posh Dearborn, Michigan, offices of Henry Ford, the car maker. \"Mr. Ford,\" announced Norman Cohen, the eldest of the three. \"We have a remarkable invention that will revolutionize the automobile industry.\"\n\nFord looked skeptical, but their threat to offer it to the competition kept his interest piqued. \"We would like to demonstrate it to you in person.\"\n\nAfter a little cajoling, they brought Mr. Ford outside and asked him to enter a black automobile parked in front of the building.\n\nHyman Cohen, the middle brother, opened the door of the car.\n\n\"Please step inside, Mr. Ford.\"\n\n\"What!\" shouted the tycoon, \"Are you crazy? It must be two hundred degrees in that car!\"\n\n\"It is,\" smiled the youngest brother, Max, \"but sit down Mr. Ford, and push the white button.\"\n\nIntrigued, Ford pushed the button. All of a sudden a whoosh of freezing air started blowing from vents all around the car, and within seconds the automobile was not only comfortable, it was quite cool.\n\n\"This is amazing!\" exclaimed Ford. \"How much do you want for the patent?\"\n\nNorman spoke up, \"The price is one million dollars.\" Then he paused. \"And there is something else: The name 'Cohen Brothers Air-Conditioning' must be stamped right next to the Ford logo!\"\n\n\"Money is no problem,\" retorted Ford, \"but no way will I have a Jewish name next to my logo on my cars!'\n\nThey haggled back and forth for a while and finally they settled. Five million dollars, but the Cohens' name would be left off. However, the first names of the Cohen brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every Ford air conditioning system.\n\nAnd that is why, even today, whenever you enter a Ford vehicle, you will see those three names clearly printed on the air conditioning control panel:\n\nNORM, HI and MAX\n\nUndoubtedly the use of specific names and dates (somewhat unusual in this form of humor) misleads some readers into interpreting it as a real-life anecdote rather than a joke. More important, although the story requires no additional explanation to be seen as funny, its key element is a historical context that may be lost on younger readers.\n\nThe missing context is that Henry Ford was a notorious anti-Semite who believed Jews were behind an international banking conspiracy intent upon seizing control of the world's financial systems and destroying American manufacturing. He devoted whole pages of his 1923 autobiography, My Life and Work , to disparaging Jews. He bought the Dearborn Independent in 1919 and turned that newspaper into an outlet for running full-length articles (and later whole issues) attacking the \"Jewish banking conspiracy.\" He presumed the hoax booklet The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion — a forgery concocted to stir up hatred of Jews by furnishing proof that Jewish leaders were secretly planning to attain world domination — was real and serialized it in his newspaper, where installments were run for 91 weeks under the headline \"The International Jew.\"\n\nSo, this joke is more than just a tale of three inventors who manage to cleverly sneak their names onto someone else's product; it's also a put-down of Henry Ford and his anti-Semitism. Not only do three Jewish inventors arrange a way to display their names in every car produced by Ford despite his unyielding objections to placing \"Jewish names\" on his product, they manipulate him into agreeing to a quintupled price (a staggering $5 million) under the belief that his paying extra millions of dollars will keep their names off his automobiles.\n\nYet even minus the historical context of Henry Ford's feelings about Jews, the story works for the same reason the $250 cookie recipe legend does — at its heart, it's a tale of the little guy's successfully taking on the large corporation and winning. We like tales in which the underdog comes out on top because such stories leave open the possibility that maybe when it's our turn to go up against the big guys, we too might win. At the very least, such stories foster a sense of hope. In this case, that the underdogs succeed through a bit of sneakiness seems nothing but appropriate because we don't view them as having been fairly treated.\n\nFor the record, as far as we know the first American automobile in which factory-installed air conditioning was offered as an option was the 1940 Packard.\n\nVariations: Different versions of this joke use a variety of Jewish-sounding last names for the brothers, including Katz, Rosenberg, and Goldberg."

      "article_title": "Is 'Luciferase' the Name for the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn the spring of 2021, COVID-19 and vaccine conspiracy theorists enthusiastically shared a meme that claimed one or all of the COVID-19 vaccines available at that time were \"called luciferase,\" and effectively warned readers not to accept them due to satanic connotations or associations.\n\nThe meme, shared widely on Facebook in March and April 2021, read as follows:\n\n\"Are you going to get the shot called LUCIFERASE with a patent number 060606 and digital program called INFERNO?\"\n\nLuciferase is a real scientific term that describes a group of naturally occurring enzymes that, under the correct conditions, cause the emission of light. However, the meme was grossly misleading and inaccurate in several ways: No COVID-19 vaccine is \"called\" luciferase, and no COVID-19 vaccine contains luciferase. Rather, luciferase has been used in some COVID-19-related research.\n\nFurthermore, the concerns over the name of the enzyme were irrational and appeared to be based on a lack of understanding of the origins of the word. On the whole, we're issuing a rating of \"False\" as to the claim that COVID-19 vaccines are \"called luciferase.\"\n\nLuciferase refers to a group of enzymes (substances that trigger chemical reactions), which act upon a type of chemical compound called luciferins , with the result being bioluminescence — that is, the emission of light by a living organism. The most common example of the work of luciferase is found in fireflies.\n\nLuciferase enzymes and luciferin compounds were discovered in the late 19th century by French scientist Raphaël Dubois. Their names are derived from the Latin roots \"lux,\" meaning light, and \"fero,\" meaning to bring or carry — thus, \"light-bearing.\"\n\nSo, contrary to the misplaced fears of a satanic association or connotation underlying the meme, the \"Lucifer\" of the Christian tradition merely has the same etymological roots as \"luciferase\" enzymes and \"luciferin\" compounds.\n\nNo COVID-19 vaccine is \"called luciferase\" and neither do any of them contain the enzymes in question, as shown in the full ingredient lists for the Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna , AstraZeneca , and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines.\n\nIn reality, the only link between luciferase and COVID-19 vaccines is that some research has used the enzymes to study issues related to COVID-19 and vaccine candidates. Because of the light-emitting properties of luciferase, they are useful in tracking biological processes.\n\nIn 2020, for example, researchers in the laboratory of Pei-Yong Shi at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston used luciferase in both diagnosing the presence of COVID-19 antibodies in subjects, but also in testing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Texas Medical Center wrote at the time that:\n\nResearchers harnessed luciferase to develop faster diagnostic testing through innovative assays—investigative procedures that measure the activity or amount of a substance. The lab can now visually confirm the presence of antibodies that can block a SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier than through previous methods.\n\n...Shi said his team has been collaborating with leading pharmaceutical companies to help them evaluate their vaccine candidates, specifically by measuring the immune response in humans in clinical trials. His lab’s system—based on reporter viruses in which the luciferase enzyme is inserted into the virus’ genome to make it easy to follow—measures the concentration of neutralizing antibodies while also allowing for a much higher throughput. According to Xuping Xie, Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UTMB, this way of measuring the immune response is more accurate than traditional methods.\n\n“The sensitivity and the dynamics of the assay, because of the luciferase, can really allow us to discern any small changes that the conventional way would not,” said Xie. “It’s much more sensitive, much more accurate, when you test antiviral compounds.”\n\nResearchers at the University of South Florida also used luciferase to track the effect and spread of the COVID-19 virus within the body. Tom McDonald explained the research as follows:\n\nIt’s a good surrogate for whether or not the virus can get into a particular cell type, and you can actually quantify it. You say it gets in more, it gets in less, that type of comparison is easily made with the firefly luciferase.\n\nDr. McDonald explains by adding that virus to lung, heart, and vascular cells, they can see how well the virus gets into those cells and which ones are vulnerable.\n\n“When you have this, they glow in the dark,” said McDonald. “You don’t have any background noise here so that your ability to precisely quantify how much of the virus is getting in by this technique is very precise.”\n\nThe second component of the meme — the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have a \"patent number 060606\" — is also inaccurate and one we have examined in greater detail previously .\n\nSnopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter.

      "article_title": "Was Crisco Invented for Use as a Submarine Lubricant?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nCrisco wasn’t invented by or for the German Navy, or for the purpose of lubricating submarines. Hydrogenation, the process by which Crisco is made from vegetable oils, was invented by German chemist Wilhelm Normann in 1901. Whether Crisco or similar products were ever used as submarine lubricants remains undetermined.\n\nCrisco was lauded as a revolutionary addition to the kitchen at its inception. The first shortening product made entirely of vegetable oils, Crisco has a higher melting point than other oils and has become a versatile alternative to bakers in commercial and home kitchens alike.\n\nIn recent years, Crisco has also become the subject of online rumors, as claims online and on social media suggested that the German government invented the product as a lubricant for its submarine fleet in 1901.\n\nThe Crisco brand was launched in 1911 , according to the company's website. Originally made from hydrogenated cottonseed oil, as of 2023 Crisco contained a combination of soybean and palm oils, among other ingredients.\n\nA spokesperson for the American Oil Chemists' Society (AOCS) told Snopes that the German navy had no record of using Crisco, and that without evidence to substantiate it, the notion is \"just conjecture.\" As such, we have rated this claim as \"Unfounded.\"\n\nSnopes traced the claim to a video shared on YouTube on Dec. 10, 2019, (archived here ) by Joel Wallach, co-founder of the lifestyle company Youngevity International, Inc. (YGI), which sells nutritional and wellness products. As Lead Stories reported in May 2023, YGI described Wallach as a research veterinarian and naturopathic physician who believes that \"all humans require 90 essential nutrients to achieve and maintain optimal health.\" (Snopes contacted Youngevity for comment and will update this article should we receive a response.)\n\nIn the video, Wallach made several unfounded claims regarding cholesterol, and to support his argument (and presumably his business), Wallach stated:\n\nIt all started back in 1901 when a German chemist was actually commissioned, I guess would be the word, by the German navy, to come up with a lubricant – a synthetic lubricant – for diesel engines used in submarines, and he was successful.\n\nWallach added that this chemist, Wilhelm Normann, eventually sold his patent to Procter & Gamble for use in the food market.\n\nIt is true that in 1901, Normann invented hydrogenation , a chemical process that would eventually provide the foundation for the process of making liquid oils, margarine, and soaps. Hydrogenation reduces or saturates organic compounds to make vegetable oils and is not unique to Crisco, according to the AOCS Lipid Library .\n\nChem Europe , an international organization of chemical societies, wrote that Normann patented the technology (patent number 141,029) in Germany on Aug. 14, 1902, and in Britain (patent number 1515 ) on Jan. 21, 1903. It was described as a \"Process for Converting Unsaturated Fatty Acids or their Glycerides into Saturated Compounds.\"\n\nCrisco was created a decade after hydrogenation. The historical record shows that the chemistry came before the application.\n\nAccording to 2007 research published in The Journal of Industrial Engineering Chemistry , work began in 1908 to bring hydrogenation technology to the U.S., resulting in two patents issued in 1910 — Food Products 1,135,351 and 1,135,951 — both of which were granted on April 13, 1915, and assigned to Proctor and Gamble Co., Cincinnati, Ohio:\n\nNote that about five years elapsed from the time that the patents were applied for until their issuance. The former is based on partial hydrogenation of cottonseed while the latter is based on blending completely hydrogenated cottonseed oil with liquid cottonseed oil.\n\nRebecca Guenard, AOCS director of publications, told Snopes via email that the organization had nothing in its archives \"that would indicate Crisco was invented by the German government for the purpose of lubrication.\"\n\n\"The primary application for hydrogenated vegetable oils was as an animal fat replacement in food. Besides, at the turn of the 20th century, petroleum-based lubricants were already realized as superior,\" concluded Guenard.\n\nCrisco was marketed as a brand name for the first time in 1911 and was originally made from hydrogenated cottonseed oil. In 2023, ingredients in Crisco had changed and contained a combination of soybean and palm oils – not the same ingredients as in 1901. At the time of this publication, Crisco's ingredient list included the following:\n\nSoybean Oil, Fully Hydrogenated Palm Oil, Palm Oil, Mono and Diglycerides, TBHQ and Citric Acid (Antioxidants), Natural and Artificial Flavor, Beta-carotene (Pro Vitamin A) Added for Color. 50% Less Saturated Fat than Butter*Crisco Shortening: 3.5g saturated fat per tablespoon.\n\n\"Animal and vegetable oils have been used as lubricants for centuries. So, it is not the wildest idea,\" wrote Guenard, adding that, \"The German government certainly could have attempted to use a hydrogenated oil for lubrication before the brand name was invented.\"\n\nSnopes also contacted Crisco and the Naval History and Heritage Command for further information regarding the historical context of Crisco’s invention and will update this article accordingly."

      "article_title": "Did Scientists Cure Cancer, But No One Took Notice?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nPreliminary research indicated dichloroacetate (DCA) might show promise for treating some forms of cancer.\n\nDCA is a not a proven \"cure\" for cancer, nor is it being spurned by pharmaceutical companies because it is not patentable.\n\nCanadian researchers find a simple cure for cancer, but major pharmaceutical companies are not interested.\n\nResearchers at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada have cured cancer last week, yet there is a little ripple in the news or in TV. It is a simple technique using very basic drug. The method employs dichloroacetate, which is currently used to treat metabolic disorders. So, there is no concern of side effects or about their long term effects.\n\nThis drug doesn't require a patent, so anyone can employ it widely and cheaply compared to the costly cancer drugs produced by major pharmaceutical companies.\n\nCanadian scientists tested this dichloroacetate (DCA) on human's cells; it killed lung, breast and brain cancer cells and left the healthy cells alone. It was tested on Rats inflicted with severe tumors; their cells shrank when they were fed with water supplemented with DCA. The drug is widely available and the technique is easy to use, why the major drug companies are not involved? Or the Media interested in this find?\n\nIn human bodies there is a natural cancer fighting human cell, the mitochondria, but they need to be triggered to be effective. Scientists used to think that these mitochondria cells were damaged and thus ineffective against cancer. So they used to focus on glycolysis, which is less effective in curing cancer and more wasteful. The drug manufacturers focused on this glycolysis method to fight cancer. This DCA on the other hand doesn't rely on glycolysis instead on mitochondria; it triggers the mitochondria which in turn fights the cancer cells.\n\nThe side effect of this is it also reactivates a process called apoptosis. You see, mitochondria contain an all-too-important self-destruct button that can't be pressed in cancer cells. Without it, tumors grow larger as cells refuse to be extinguished. Fully functioning mitochondria, thanks to DCA, can once again die.\n\nWith glycolysis turned off, the body produces less lactic acid, so the bad tissue around cancer cells doesn't break down and seed new tumors.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are not investing in this research because DCA method cannot be patented, without a patent they can't make money, like they are doing now with their AIDS Patent. Since the pharmaceutical companies won't develop this, the article says other independent laboratories should start producing this drug and do more research to confirm all the above findings and produce drugs. All the groundwork can be done in collaboration with the Universities, who will be glad to assist in such research and can develop an effective drug for curing cancer.\n\nIn 2007, medical researchers at the University of Alberta reported that dichloroacetate (DCA), a relatively simple compound, had showed promise for treating cancer in rodent models, and the university's DCA Research Team announced they would begin clinical trials of DCA on human patients in the spring of 2007. One of the members of that research team, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis, expressed concern that because DCA was not patented, the potential profit margins in marketing it would likely be small, and thus it might be difficult to obtain funding for DCA clinical trials from private investors:\n\nThe DCA compound is not patented and not owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, says Michelakis, the Canada Research Chair in Pulmonary Hypertension and Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Program with Capital Health, one of Canada's largest health authorities.\n\nHowever, as DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials. He is grateful for the support he has already received from publicly funded agencies, such as the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and he is hopeful such support will continue and allow him to conduct clinical trials of DCA on cancer patients.\n\nUnfortunately, this preliminary information soon led to hyperbolic claims that a \"simple cure for cancer\" had been found but a lack of interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies was preventing it from reaching cancer patients, prompting some desperate cancer sufferers to seek it out for themselves from unscrupulous vendors:\n\nNote that there were two assumptions about the study [in 2007]. First, these bloggers and pundits assumed that the cell culture and animal work were definitive evidence that DCA might be a \"cure\" for cancer. Second, the assumption was that, because the drug was out of patent and very cheap to make, neither the government nor pharmaceutical companies would be interested in funding it, thus condemning thousands, maybe millions, of people to die of cancer unnecessarily. Unfortunately, [articles] featured headlines to that effect and quotes by the investigator Evangelos Michelakis lamenting how he had had difficulties finding funding to do the next step, clinical trials in cancer. As a result of these sensationalistic stories, unscrupulous \"businessmen\" sought to bring DCA to the masses. A frenzy of sorts was unleashed, with desperate cancer patients scrambling to find DCA.\n\nDespite investigators' concerns about potential difficulties in obtaining funding, DCA studies have been undertaken, and in 2010 the substance was in the news again after researchers published a paper reporting their results with testing DCA on glioblastoma tumors:\n\nThe researchers looked at the impact of DCA on tumor cells from patients with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma, which generally does not respond well to treatment.\n\nThey performed some very sophisticated lab experiments which demonstrated the impact of DCA on the tumor cells from 49 patients with this cancer. The experiments generally support the effectiveness of DCA at altering cell behavior.\n\nThe investigators also treated five patients who had glioblastoma with DCA. The only side effect they found was a reversible change in peripheral nerve function. No other side effects were described. Of the five patients, three had progressing disease despite prior treatment and two were newly diagnosed. Those two patients were treated with different protocols. The results of the treatments were variable as were the approaches to treatment. Nonetheless, the report shows some MRI pictures pre and post treatment which show regression of the cancers in two patients.\n\nAs Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for the national office of the American Cancer Society, wrote of that last study in 2010, DCA studies appear to be worth pursuing, but the substance is still far from being proved an effective treatment for any type of cancer, much less a cancer \"cure\":\n\nHow would I characterize this report?\n\nSimply stated, the science is intriguing and I believe is something to be pursued both in the lab and in the clinic. BUT, and this is a big but, it is not a cure for glioblastoma or any other cancer based on these results.\n\nMy concern is that this paper is going to be transformed — like the last one — into something that it is not, namely that this is definitive evidence that DCA is the magic bullet for cancer treatment, particularly in glioblastoma (which is a cancer that has a very poor prognosis).\n\nThis research still needs lots of work before we know whether it works or doesn't work, and whether it is really safe or not when given to patients with cancer under a variety of circumstances.\n\nIf that sounds overly cautious, so be it. I have seen too many dashed hopes in my medical career which make me a bit cautious about reports like this. That's not to say I don't think it could work — it could, as I mentioned above — but I want to see evidence in well done trials that prove the point that DCA is effective in the treatment of which cancers under what circumstances.\n\nIn the case of DCA, internet traffic zoomed with reports of its purported success in curing cancer — in lab animals. Clinics sprung up, and are probably still active. The risk is that we are going to see a resurgence of this now that the new report has been issued.\n\nWe shall see how this progresses. Hopefully, clinical trials will proceed appropriately.\n\nAnd I stand by my skepticism, while encouraging further research to answer the fundamental question whether or not DCA really works in treating cancer.\n\nIn the meantime, caution is advised. Don't become the victim of a cancer scam. The scamsters are sure to follow this report as night follows day.\n\nAs New Scientist noted as recently as July 2016, dichloroacetate still has not lived up to the potential ascribed to it several years ago:\n\nAlmost a decade ago, New Scientist broke a story about dichloroacetate (DCA), a simple chemical used to treat rare metabolic disorders that was also showing remarkable cancer-killing properties. We were inundated with requests for more information — including how to enroll in clinical trials or buy the drug online.\n\nDCA was worth investigating as a cancer treatment, but [it] has yet to live up to its promise. The US Food and Drug Administration eventually had to step in and shut down websites selling it illegally."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nOn Nov. 13, 2022, the Instagram account for @wealth shared a picture that read, \"Disney Files Patent for Roller Coaster that Jumps Track.\" However, this headline originated on a website that publishes satirical content about Disney's theme parks. We received an inquiry about this post from a reader's email.\n\n'The Park Will Be Shut Down'\n\nThe @wealth account added no hashtags or other notes that said the post was intended as satire or parody. This led some users to post comments that appeared to show they believed it was real news.\n\nOne user commented, \"How?? Wind gust variations, body weight variations, miss the track by 1/4 inch and everybody on that ride is dead!\" Another person replied, \"Imagine the wrong weight distribution… Disney trying to crash their stock price further than it already has.\" A third commenter said, \"A good amount of the rides at Disneyland kept breaking down this week. Please fix your current rides before you focus on a new one.\"\n\nIn two other examples of comments where people believed the news was real, one person said, \"Not good for mental health people. This is stupid. The park will be shut down.\" Another person posted, \"Too many variables... mainly body weight and weather conditions. There will be a catastrophic accident sooner than later.\"\n\nBeyond these users, some people took a more humorous route. One person referred to a classic computer game that allows players to design roller coasters, and said, \"I made this in RollerCoaster Tycoon. Cut me a check.\" Others drew comparisons to the film \"Final Destination 3,\" which included a violent roller coaster crash scene.\n\nNote: In the bio for the @wealth Instagram account, it mentions that it specializes in posts about business, motivation, and technology, and called itself the \"World's #1 Self Development & Business Blog!\" Other posts on the account showed motivational quotes and business-related news, among other types of content.\n\nThe Mouse Trap\n\nA quick search of Google showed that the \"Disney Files Patent for Roller Coaster that Jumps Track\" headline originally came from the satirical website known as The Mouse Trap on mousetrapnews.com. The website was named in honor of Mickey Mouse, with its humorous slogan being, \"The Moused Trusted Name in News.\"\n\nWe previously reported on other satirical articles from the fun-filled website, including stories that said Disney World would be removing Cinderella Castle , lowering the drinking age to 18 , and cancelling the Splash Mountain re-theme .\n\nThe Mouse Trap published their article about the roller coaster on Oct. 30. Part of the story read as follows:\n\nWalt Disney Imagineering (WDI) just filed a patent for a roller coaster that jumps the track. This means the rollercoaster will fly through the air during part of the ride, with no track under it. The classic video game Thrillville: Off the Rails had a roller coaster that jumps the track on the cover of the game. This was a crazy idea that no one actually thought could work, but now Disney is trying to make that dream a reality.\n\nOn the website's \"About\" page , it displayed a disclaimer that said, \"The Mouse Trap is the world's best satire site.\" The disclaimer also added that the website focused on Disney Parks simply for the sake of \"fun.\"\n\nUpdates from @wealth\n\nThe @wealth Instagram account later published two comments to update its followers about the news. One comment read, \"Update: They have filed the patent merely to protect the idea if they ever decide to do it. This doesn't guarantee they build the ride!\"\n\nThe second comment said, \"Note: Photos aren't an actual visual of what the ride will become, but potentially a glimpse of what it could look like.\"\n\nBoth of these pieces of information came from the satirical article on The Mouse Trap's website, which again, was not a real news story."

      "article_title": "Is This a Real Deep-Sea Diving Suit from 1925?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nFact Check\n\nA vintage photograph perennially shared on social media purports to show an actual deep-sea diving suit from 1925 that looks more like a mash-up of the Tin Man from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Robby the Robot , the clunky (but lovable) robot character in the 1956 science fiction film \"Forbidden Planet.\" Here's the photograph as posted on Facebook :\n\nAs we'll document below, both the photograph (which actually dates from 1931) and the suit are genuine.\n\nBut let's talk first about about why people seem to find this picture so shareworthy. Is it because in 1925 full-body diving suits were a novelty? No, because they weren't. What's known as a \" standard diving dress \" — consisting of a metal helmet, a hose to supply air pumped in from the surface, a canvas diving suit, and boots — was developed in the 19th century and in wide use by the early 20th. The photograph below shows a well-worn standard diving suit in use in the 1920s and '30s. It's likely what most people picture when they think of vintage, deep-sea diving gear.\n\nThe differences between standard diving dress and the rigid, robot-like contraption in the viral photo are readily apparent. Some people may be shocked to learn that the latter was real.\n\n\"Submarine armor,\" as the all-metal diving suit equipped with special rotary joints for mobility was dubbed in the title of its 1914 patent application , was intended by its inventor, Harry L. Bowdoin of New Jersey, to offer divers a stronger, more efficient alternative to the standard dress for accomplishing underwater tasks, particularly in very deep water.\n\nIt was also intended to enrich the inventor himself. According to its prospectus, \"The Deep Sea Salvage Corporation,\" a company Bowdoin started in 1916, \"has been organized to construct and operate a metal diving suit to be used for deep sea diving, locating and recovering specie and other valuables contained in the cargoes of sunken ships at depths which it has been impossible to reach with the diving apparatus ordinarily in use.\" A laundry list of Bowdoin's planned deep-sea, fortune-hunting destinations took up more than half of a May 1916 article about him in Vermont's Rutland Daily Herald.\n\nIt took Bowdoin 12 years to build and perfect the suit, which in the end weighed 1,400 pounds and was all too often described in the press as a \"robot.\" (The viral Facebook photo can also be found on Getty Images , where it has a caption identifying the man standing beside the suit as the inventor himself.) Bowdoin launched his first actual expedition in search of tens of millions of dollars worth of sunken treasure in 1928, at the age of 60. \"The inventive Long Islander was not over-willing to talk of his brain-child and the feats he hopes to accomplish,\" reported the New York Daily News in April of that year. \"Wait until I get the money,\" Bowdoin told the paper.\n\nThough Bowdoin's \"submarine armor\" performed as he expected under deep-sea conditions, it doesn't appear that his fortune-hunting ventures resulted in that much success. When he died in 1935, his obituary made much of Bowdoin's diving apparatus and a new expedition on which he was preparing to embark, but had little to say about the outcomes of his previous attempts to recover sunken treasure. Except, the obituary noted, a voyage two years prior yielded nothing but an empty safe."

      "article_title": "Did a Study Prove That Airport Scanners 'Rip Apart' Your DNA?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nOn 19 February 2017, conspiracy and metaphysics web site \"Collective Evolution\" published an article (titled \"Los Alamos Study Finds Airport Scanners Can Rip Apart & Alter DNA\") that was written by Kathy J. Froti, a clinical psychologist with no professional background in biology or physics who claims to have been taught \"how key mathematical information affects the consciousness of the cells\" from \"multi-dimensional beings of light whose goal is to bring healing to our world\" after a near-death experience.\n\nIn that post, she reviews a litany of complaints about the older backscatter x-ray scanners once employed by the Transportation Security Administration before diving into perceived health risks of the newer, millimeter wave technology:\n\nNow they also want us to believe that the replacement technology, millimeter wave “digital strip search” scanners, are also “perfectly safe”. Don’t believe it for a second. [...] These millimeter wave technologies are designed to bombard innocent travelers with high frequency energy particles known as terahertz photons.\n\nA study conducted by Boian S. Alexandrov et.al. at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, revealed that these terahertz waves could “…unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.”\n\nThe new technology Froti describes, referred to by the TSA as \"millimeter wave Advanced Imaging Technology\", has been in common use at American airports since 2012. It works by bouncing electromagnetic waves of a specific frequency range called terahertz radiation, which is described in a 2007 report on its potential for security applications:\n\nTerahertz (THz) waves, or submillimeter/far-infrared waves, refer to electromagnetic radiation in the frequency interval from 0.1 to 10 THz. They occupy a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the mid-infrared and microwave bands.\n\nTo support her argument that these devices are dangerous, she links to a 2009 MIT Technology Review article discussing a study (the “Los Alamos study”) that sought to address interactions between the natural frequencies present in the hydrogen bonds of DNA and a THz field:\n\nAt first glance, it’s easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us. But could there be another mechanism at work? [...]\n\n[Lead author of the study Boian] Alexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what they’ve found is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nBecause (and despite Froti's claim of \"high energy\") these electric fields are not strong enough to actually cleave chemical bonds, they reasoned that another mechanism must be present if terahertz fields are to impart any biologic effect. In their study , Alexandrov and colleagues wanted to investigate the possibility that terahertz radiation, because it is similar in frequencies of energy holding hydrogen bonds together, could possibly interact in a way so as to amplify each other’s signals to the point where it could break chemical bonds:\n\nThe energy of [terahertz] radiation is too low to directly disrupt any chemical bonds or cause electronic transitions. Only a resonance-type interaction might lead to an appreciable, biological effect. In biomolecules such interactions are possible through the ubiquitous hydrogen bonds that have energies in the THz range.\n\nUltimately, the authors found that while unlikely, it is possible that, under a set of remarkably specific conditions, such a phenomenon is possible :\n\nWe have found that a THz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double strand. In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, small amplitude response occurs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uniform manner or, at higher frequencies, in an unusual spatially dimerized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in an out-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude threshold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.\n\nOne reason Froti may have avoided the study itself is that it makes no mention of airport scanners, although the MIT Technology Review article did use them as a news hook for its story. According to the actual authors of the paper, however, their research holds no relevance to airport scanners. In an e-mail, Alexandrov (the lead author of the \"Los Alamos\" study), told us:\n\nOur project is still at the level of exploratory basic research, and we have drawn no connections to full-body scanners.\n\nCo-author Anny Usheva reiterated this point via email as well:\n\nWe never investigated if THz cleaves DNA. It has never been investigated how scanners alter DNA and the biological THz effect in the time frames that are relevant to the scanning procedures.\n\nIndeed, she clarified that her research (on which she said they have made progress but are held up due to a lack of funding) aims to use THz radiation over much longer intervals of time to \"reprogram\" cells for regenerative medicine:\n\nThe work is collaborative with my lab at Harvard Medical School/presently at Brown and Los Alamos. We do the laser/THz part at Los Alamos. As a corresponding author of these publications, I am confident to say that there is a biological effect after 8 hours of continuous broad band (0.1-10 THz) exposure . Our goal at the moment is to achieve massive and fast reprogramming of cells (outside of the body) for the needs of the regenerative medicine.\n\nNeedless to say, an airport scanner does not expose travellers to eight hours of continuous radiation. The federally funded research and development center Pacific Northwest Laboratories highlights the actual time frame on a page describing the development of the TSA’s scanners:\n\nScans [are] completed in 1-2 seconds using a two-array system to keep people moving through security check points quickly.\n\nThat same website, conveniently, lists all of the patents associated with the TSA's millimeter wave technology. While there are several frequency ranges associated with the methodologies patented to analyze millimeter data, the three patents that describe the actual device employed by TSA makes it clear that only a small fraction of the terahertz range is utilized, as described in the most recent patent filing:\n\nA holographic apparatus for near real-time imaging of a target, said apparatus utilizing millimeter wave radiation having a plurality of frequencies from about 1 to about 110 GHz .\n\nExpressed in GHz, the broadband exposure (i.e. multiple wavelengths at the same time) Usheva investigated was 100 to 10,000 GHz, a range that barely overlaps with with the TSA’s stated range of 1 to 110 GHz, and a far cry from “broad band” terahertz radiation.\n\nThe authors of the study themselves refute the claims made by the \"Collective Evolution\" post and the study itself is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the technology utilized by airport scanners. As such, we rate this claim as false."

Vinpocetine is also commonly used as a Nootropic compound in the hopes that it may promote memory formation.\n\nThe web site for the supplement further claims it is \"carefully crafted with patent ingredients to provide essential nutrients to the brain.\" However we could find no patents registered in the United States for a product called InteliGEN. We were also unable to find such a product described by the medical database WebMD . And while the InteliGEN web site claims the supplement is \"clinically proven,\" we couldn't locate any evidence of clinical trials or testing on the product. In general, Examine.com urges caution with nootopic supplements:\n\nMany Nootropics have limited studies in humans, and the brain itself is still a very unknown organ. Despite the promise of many of these compounds, caution should be exerted to a larger degree when supplementing with some of them.\n\nOverall the web site for InteliGEN seems vague and does not provide a label for the product so consumers can review a full list of ingredients. It allows potential customers to fill out their personal information in order to receive a \"free bottle.\"\n\nAccording to WebMD , all the ingredients it claims to contain have are considered \"possibly safe,\" or in the case of ginkgo biloba, \"likely safe.\" All have potential side effects, and none of the ingredients should be ingested during pregnancy. Overall we can't confirm the supplement does what it claims to do, as we can't even verify what its ingredients are. As with any supplement, consult a doctor before opting to take it."

      "article_title": "Did Kodak Hide Invention of the Digital Camera in the '70s to Avoid Loss of Film Sales?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nKodak engineer Steve Sasson invented the first portable, digital camera in 1975. Kodak received a patent for the device in 1978, but did not put it into production.\n\nWhile Kodak did not push forward with production in 1975 and challenged the wisdom of moving away from its camera-film market, the company's reasoning for not developing it then was largely due to the device not being ready or practical for the market.\n\nA long-standing internet claim holds that the film and camera company Eastman Kodak invented the first digital camera, but kept the invention hidden from the public because of the threat it posed to its photographic-film-based business model:\n\nAspects of this meme are true. Though larger-scale applications involving the digitization of images already existed, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created the first portable digital camera in 1975. He demonstrated the product to the company's executives, and they decided to patent the technology but not to develop it for sale.\n\nIt is an oversimplification to say that a fear over a future film-less world led Kodak to \"hide\" the invention from the public, in part because it neglects the fact that the product was not ready at the time, that no real market for the product existed in 1975, and that Kodak further developed digital cameras following this initial invention. Kodak received substantial sums from the patent it received for Sasson's device in 1978, as well.\n\nIn 1973, at age 23, Sasson took a job as an electrical engineer at Kodak. As described by The New York Times in 2015, \"soon after arriving at Kodak, Mr. Sasson was given a seemingly unimportant task — to see whether there was any practical use for a charged coupled device (CCD), which had been invented a few years earlier.\" Such devices can translate light to digital signals, and are key to all digital cameras.\n\nTwo years later, he had finished his device — a Frankensteined mishmash of leftover lenses, circuits, and a cassette tape for memory. As described by the Times:\n\nThe final result was a Rube Goldberg device with a lens scavenged from a used Super-8 movie camera; a portable digital cassette recorder; 16 nickel cadmium batteries; an analog/digital converter; and several dozen circuits — all wired together on half a dozen circuit boards.\n\nBy 1976, Sasson was ready to demo the invention to executives at Kodak, as he described to the photography outlet PetaPixel:\n\n\"I would walk in with my crazy-looking camera, which was about the size of a toaster, but I could hold it,\" Sasson says. \"I took pictures of people in the room before I said anything. Then I took out the tape that the digital information was stored on and put it in the playback unit when a picture popped up on the TV screen. And that generally got everybody's attention.\"\n\n\"Indeed, they didn't ask me how this worked,\" Sasson says. They simply asked me why anybody would want to take a picture this way when there was nothing wrong with conventional photography. Nobody [including the bosses at Kodak] was asking me to develop this camera. In fact, nobody even knew that I was developing this camera.\n\nThe file size of the picture it produced — a black, white, and gray grid of 100 by 100 pixels — was 5 kilobytes. It took nearly a half a minute to save the data from the image to a cassette tape. \"It only took 50 milliseconds to capture the image, but it took 23 seconds to record it to the tape,\" Sasson said .\n\nWhen asked how long before this technology could match that of a film camera, Sasson figured it was about 15-20 years away. At the time, the photographs had to be displayed on a TV. Personal computers were far from ubiquitous — the first Apple I computer kit was released a year later in 1976.\n\nBusiness and marketing directors at Kodak were, indeed, skeptical of the wisdom of creating a product that could potentially make their photographic-film business obsolete. As reported in the Times, \"Kodak's marketing department was not interested in [Sasson's prototypes]. Mr. Sasson was told they could sell the camera, but wouldn't — because it would eat away at the company's film sales.\"\n\nWhile this may have been a motivating factor to some at Kodak, such concerns did not stop Kodak — or even Sasson — from further developing digital cameras and making several technical developments that led to Kodak's first publicly available digital camera in 1991, the Digital Camera System. As reported in a 1991 Associated Press article:\n\nEastman Kodak Co is taking its first step into filmless photography with an electronic camera system that can turn a conventional Nikon into a high-tech electronic camera. The Professional Digital Camera System will sell for about $20000. It is intended primarily for photojournalists and government surveillance, Kodak said.\n\nSasson's developments were crucial to develop this technology. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Sasson the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his contributions to digital photography.\n\nBecause the first portable digital camera was, indeed, invented in 1975 by Kodak, but because concerns about destroying its film business did not stop Kodak from developing the technology further, we rate this claim as a \"Mixture\" of truth."

      "article_title": "Former Friend of Elon Musk Says Billionaire 'Believes He Is Above Everyone Else'",
      "text": "In January 2025, a post about tech billionaire Elon Musk, purportedly written by someone who knew him for years, was shared widely online. Philip Low , a scientist and founder of NeuroVigil, a company that developed a portable brain activity monitor, reportedly wrote on his social media profiles that Musk was not a Nazi, but that he \"believes he is above everyone else.\"\n\nThe post available on LinkedIn ( archived ) and Facebook ( archived ) was a response to Musk's controversial gesture at U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration rally, which many observers called a Nazi salute. The post said Low had known Musk for 14 years and that they texted frequently and went to each other's birthdays before they had a falling out. Part of the post reads:\n\nElon is not a Nazi, per se.\n\nHe is something much better, or much worse, depending on how you look at it.\n\nNazis believed that an entire race was above everyone else.\n\nElon believes he is above everyone else. He used to think he worked on the most important problems. When I met him, he did not presume to be a technical person — he would be the first to say that he lacked the expertise to understand certain data. That happened later. Now, he acts as if he has all the solutions.\n\n[…]\n\nElon did two Nazi salutes.\n\nHe did them for five main reasons: 1. He was concerned that the \"Nazi wing\" of the MAGA movement, under the influence of Steve Bannon, would drive him away from Trump, somewhere in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, rather than in the West Wing which is where he wants to be. He was already feeling raw over the fact that Trump did not follow his recommendation for Treasury Secretary and that the Senate also did not pick his first choice; 2. He was upset that he had had to go to Israel and Auschwitz to make up for agreeing with a Nazi sympathizer online and wanted to reclaim his \"power\" just like when he told advertisers to \"go f*** yourself\". This has nothing to do with Asperger's; 3. There are some Jews he actually hates: Sam Altman is amongst them; 4. He enjoys a good thrill and knew exactly what he was doing; 5. His narcissistic self was hoping the audience would reflect his abject gesture back to him, thereby showing complete control and dominion over it, and increasing his leverage over Trump. That did not happen. Bottom line: Elon is not a Nazi but he did give two Nazi Salutes, which is completely unacceptable.\n\nLow and Musk did have a prior connection, as evidenced by their appearance in an interview together, and Musk's early investment in NeuroVigil. However, we do not know the extent of their relationship, nor are we able to independently verify the claims Low makes in his post. We have reached out to Low and Musk through their companies to learn more about their former friendship and will update this post if we receive more information.\n\nA NeuroVigil spokesperson told Snopes that the LinkedIn and Facebook posts were indeed written by Low and from his authentic social media accounts. The spokesperson also told us that Musk and Low became friends after meeting in France in 2011.\n\nWe found a 2013 interview with Low and Musk, where they are seated together and speak about their work with scientist Crystal Dilworth. Per the video description : \"Dr. Crystal Dilworth engages in a fireside chat with space entrepreneur Elon Musk and inventor and computational neuroscientist Philip Low to discover how they are changing the world and why.\"\n\nThe website for NeuroVigil also listed Musk as an adviser but noted that his services had been terminated. Alongside Musk's bio, it read:\n\nMr. Musk's services as an advisor to NeuroVigil were terminated with cause by Dr. Low on December 17th 2021.\n\nMr. Musk has never held day-to-day operating functions with NeuroVigil, does not speak on behalf of NeuroVigil, and his views, including on neuroscience, artificial intelligence, the COVID-19 pandemic, certain public officials and rescue personnel, animal experimentation, CEO compensation and crypto currencies certainly do not reflect the views of the company.\n\nMr. Musk owns less than 0.05% of NeuroVigil and has not been personally invited to re-invest in the company.\n\nIn a post from his verified Facebook account, Low gave more detail on Musk's alleged power plays and how his relationship with Musk worsened over time, including an interaction with Musk's ex-wife years ago (emphasis ours):\n\nAll his talk about getting to Mars to \"maintain the light of consciousness\" or about \"free speech absolutism\" is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far right parties, because they are easier to control. That is also why he gave himself $56 Billion which could have gone to the people actually doing the work and innovations he is taking credit for at Tesla (the reason he does not do patents is because he would not be listed as an inventor as putting a fake inventor on a patent would kill it and moreover it would reveal the superstars behind the work). His lust for power is also why he did xAI and Neuralink, to attempt to compete with OpenAI and NeuroVigil, respectively, despite being affiliated with them. Unlike Tesla and Twitter, he was unable to conquer those companies and tried to create rivals. He announced Neuralink just after I invited his ex-wife, which she and I notified him about, to a fundraising dinner for Hebrew University in London (The fact that she tried to kiss me — I immediately pushed her away — while taking a photo at that event, even if playfully, clearly may have added to the alienation and possible emasculation he may have felt when she spoke to me in a pool at a party when they were together and she was naked. To not be disrespectful to her or to him, I stayed but looked at the sky whilst talking to her). I fired him with cause in December 2021 when he tried to undermine [NeuroVigil]. It is ironic that years later, he clearly tried to undermine Twitter before buying it, and in my view, blowing it up and using it to manipulate the masses to lean to the far right in country after country, including the USA.\n\nWhile the above statement by Low is from his verified social media account, we cannot confirm the claims within the statement. We do know, however, that Low and Musk had a prior connection through their work, though we do not have all the details on how their personal friendship deteriorated. We will update this story if we hear more from Musk."

      "article_title": "Did Emma Raducanu Trademark Her Own Name Hours After US Open Win?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn September 2021, after English tennis player Emma Raducanu completed a sensational underdog victory at the U.S. Open, various outlets reported that she had applied to trademark her own name in the U.K.\n\nFor example, on Sept. 16, the British tabloid The Sun published an article with the headline \"Emma Raducanu on way to becoming a £1 BILLION athlete as she applies for her own trademark.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail , for its part, reported that:\n\nEmma Raducanu trademarked her name within hours of her US Open win in her first steps to becoming the ‘first billion-dollar sports woman’. UK-based lawyer Anthony Brierley applied to safeguard the words 'Emma Raducanu', 'Emma' and 'Raducanu' shortly after the 18-year-old's victory, reports The Sun.\n\nSimilar articles were published by Metro.co.uk and Unilad .\n\nThose reports were false. The U.K. trademark application in question was filed by Anthony Brierley, a patent attorney in Yorkshire, who has confirmed that the application was not connected to Raducanu herself. Furthermore, Brierley had already withdrawn his trademark application by Sept. 14 — two days before The Sun, the Daily Mail, and others falsely reported that Raducanu herself had applied to trademark her own name.\n\nThe day after Raducanu's victory at the U.S. Open, Brierley submitted a UK Intellectual Property Office application on Sept. 12 to trademark the following terms: \"Raducanu,\" \"Emma Raducanu,\" and \"Emma.\" The trademark application was made in connection with three categories of commercial goods: cosmetics, stationery, and clothing:\n\nOn Sept. 14, Brierley withdrew his application — two days before the publication of the news articles highlighted above, meaning those reports referred to a trademark application that was no longer active, and they therefore did not become outdated or inaccurate due to unforeseen events that took place after publication but were inaccurate at the time they were published.\n\nFurthermore, Brierley's application never had any connection with Raducanu herself. Speaking to World Trademark Review , a London-based publication that focuses on trademark issues, Brierley confirmed his application was not made at her behest .\n\nSeveral other individuals also have applied for U.K. trademarks related to Raducanu's name, including one filed on the day of her U.S. Open victory , which sought to trademark the phrases \"Radu can do,\" \"Radu-Can-Do\" and \"RaduCanDo.com.\" Another individual applied , on Sept. 14, to trademark the word \"raducando,\" and on Sept. 16, someone else applied to trademark \"Emma Raducanu\" among other phrases.\n\nThe individuals behind those trademark applications do not appear to have any personal or professional connection to Raducanu, based on preliminary research, but we can't yet rule out the possibility that they were acting on her behalf. Snopes asked Raducanu's representatives for clarification, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.\n\nIt should also be noted that, if she hasn't already, Raducanu might very well attempt to trademark her own name in the U.K. and in other countries in the near future, as one trademark expert told World Trademark Review :\n\nAchieving such financial success will require many elements outside of on-court victories – including effective brand protection. Talking to WTR , Lee Curtis , chartered trademark attorney and partner at HGF, says that “registered trademark registration will be key in leveraging the potential that brand ‘Emma Raducanu’ has become almost overnight”, adding: “Trademark registrations for her name increases the ability to control who uses that name and increases the potential of securing lucrative licensing deals ...\"\n\nHowever, the Sept. 12 application by Yorkshire attorney Anthony Brierley, which formed the basis of a wave of news reports, was certainly not filed at Raducanu's behest, was withdrawn two days later and, as a result, those articles were wildly inaccurate."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nGender equality in sports is a field historically rife with obstacles, even in the 21st century, from legal battles over equal pay to concerns over sexism and access . It wasn't until the 1970s that federal legislation prohibited sex discrimination in some sports. Paving the way for female-identifying involvement in sports came with its own hurdles and hoops.\n\nOne such obstacle blocking women's involvement in athletics was centered on anatomy: breasts. (As it turns out, this continues to be an issue for teenage girls.) Some social media posts and online claims suggested that inventors sought to remedy the issue by creating the first sports bra, which was made by \"sewing two jock straps together,\" including the below Reddit post, which had received more than 8,900 upvotes at the time of this writing.\n\nTIL the first sports bra was made in 1977 by sewing two jock straps together. Its literal test run was performed by of its two inventors: one jogging forwards wearing the Macgyvered prototype while her friend ran ahead, jogging backwards so she could assess her friend's \"bounciness\" by u/NealMcBeal__NavySeal in todayilearned\n\nMelinda Machado , director of the Office of Communications and Marketing at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , referred Snopes to the exhibit \" Change Your Game ,\" which boasts inventions and technology that \"can make the difference between victory and defeat.\"\n\nOne object on display is a prototype of the so-called \"Jogbra\" from the 1970s, which reflects the \"fitness boom at a time when women had few athletic clothing options.\"\n\nThe Jogbra was the first patented sports bra, invented by three women who sewed together jock straps. This claim is True.\n\nAlison Oswald , an archivist at the National Museum of American History, also confirmed to Snopes that there is \" primary source evidence that it was named \"Jockbra\" before being renamed 'Jogbra.'\"\n\nThis evidence includes the transcripts of three interviews with the co-inventors discussing their work conducted by Oswald. Also included in the archives is edited footage from the interviews , and the finding aid for Jogbra, Inc.\n\nA photograph of the prototype sports bra, shown below, described it as having been made by Hinda Milla and Lisa Lindahl, who \"deconstructed two men's athletic supporters and sewed the pieces\" together in 1977. (ICYMI: Athletic supporters are another name for jockstraps, according to the Urology Care Foundation .)\n\nLeft: Prototype of the original Jogbra. Right: A late 1970s Jogbra advertisement features the two co-designers as models. (Jogbra, Inc. Records, 1977-1990, Archives Center, National Museum of American History)\n\nThe patent for the \"athletic brassiere\" was filed on Dec. 1, 1978, and published 11 months later. It credited three women inventors – Hinda Schreiber (later Miller), Eugenie Lindah, and Polly Smith – and described the product as follows:\n\nAn athletic brassiere, particularly suitable for women runners, holds the breasts comfortably and snugly to the body. A wide elastic rib band and elastic straps which cross in the back hold the brassiere firmly in place. Non-irritating material is used and all seams face the outside. All hardware is eliminated. The cups are not shaped but are preferably made of elastic material to pull the breasts in snugly against the body.\n\n(Google Patents)\n\nMiller , Lindahl , and Smith were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame , a nonprofit organization that recognizes inventors. The group writes:\n\nDuring the 1970s, more women than ever before were participating in sports and fitness activities. In 1977, Lindahl, who was a runner, asked Smith, a costume designer, to help fashion an undergarment to minimize the discomfort she experienced on runs. That summer, Miller was working with Smith as an assistant designer for a Shakespeare festival in Burlington, Vermont. As someone who had been physically active since childhood, she joined the project to develop an athletic brassiere. When Smith sewed two jockstraps together and Lindahl tested them on a run, they produced a working prototype.\n\nMiller and Lindahl commercialized the invention as the Jogbra®, co-founding their company, Jogbra Inc. — later renamed JBI — in 1977 with Miller in charge of future product design, manufacturing, collaborating on marketing strategies and serving as company president. The Jogbra launched a multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nAccording to the National Museum of American History , Playtex Apparel bought the Jogbra brand in 1990 before selling it to Sara Lee Corporation in 1991. The museum wrote:\n\nThe Jogbra was the first example of the garments now known generally as sports bras, an industry that has grown in direct proportion to the increased participation of women in athletics generally since 1977. Lisa Lindahl originally wanted to solve the problem of having sore breasts after running, resulting in the invention of the jog bra which has evolved into the sports bra as we know it today.\n\nMuseum archivist Cathy Keen wrote in a 2014 column titled, \" Jogbra: Providing essential support for Title Nine and women athletes ,\" that the \"introduction of the sports bra did more than improve athletes' performances. It represented a revolution in ready-to-wear clothing, and for many women athletes, past, present, and future, it actually made sports possible.\"\n\nLindahl released a book in 2019 that chronicled the invention's worldwide impact titled  \" Unleash the Girls: The Untold Story of the Invention of the Sports Bra and How It Changed the World (And Me) .\"\n\nThe invention of the sports bra came a half-decade after Title Nine of the Civil Rights Act , which was signed into law on June 23, 1972. The amendment prohibited sex discrimination in any educational program or activity that received any type of federal financial aid, according to the advocacy group, Women's Sports Foundation . For more on the history of women's involvement in sports, check out this brief history written by the Georgia State University Library .\n\nSnopes has examined other claims related to fashion inventions , including a vintage photo that supposedly showed women in the 1930s wearing plastic, cone-shaped face masks to protect their faces in a snowstorm. We also looked into this 1923 picture of men demonstrating a bulletproof vest and the origins of \" Murmanski fur .\""

His story also garnered attention in October 2024 thanks to the opening of an exhibit named \"Pioneer Skies: From Freedom to Flight, The Story of Airship Inventor Charles F. Page\" that was assembled by the Louisiana State Museum and the Louisiana Civil Rights Museum Advisory Board at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.\n\nAccording to an August 2024 news release from the office of Billy Nungesser, Louisiana's Lieutenant Governor, \"'Pioneer Skies' delves into the rich history of aviation, highlighting Charles F. Page, a formerly enslaved man from Pineville [Louisiana] who invented an airship and, in 1906, during the Jim Crow era, received a patent for his airship, notably before the Wright Brothers.\"\n\nOther reports about Page, such as a lengthy profile in Louisiana newspaper The Advocate ( archived ), also from August 2024, emphasized the fact that the entrepreneur's patent was approved before the Wrights'.\n\nHowever, neither article notes the fact that, according to documentation from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Page's patent was filed a month later than the Wrights' patent. As shown on Page's patent, it was filed on April 24, 1903 and approved about three years later on April 10, 1906, as seen below. The Wrights' patent was filed on March 23, 1903 and approved a little over three years later on May 22, 1906. The USPTO confirmed via email that the dates listed on the patents are accurate.\n\nTherefore, Page was granted a patent before the Wright brothers but he filed for it after they did. He also filed his patent before their airplane's historic first flight.\n\n(USPTO)\n\nHowever, the USPTO said the two machines were \"very different technologies\" and \"neither patent would have affected the other being granted regardless of whose was filed first.\"\n\nThey added:\n\nAirships like Page's rely on buoyancy from balloons to lift the craft, as opposed to airplanes like the Wright Brothers' inventions. The idea of airships has been around in some form since at least the 17th century, and Page's was an improvement on existing inventions. You can think of it like comparing a sailboat to a motorboat – both require a lot of expertise to create, but they run very differently.\n\nThis absolutely does not take away from Page's accomplishments – receiving a patent and attempting to market his technology in the Jim Crow South was extremely difficult for an African American inventor during this time period. But the idea that the Wright brothers were receiving credit for something he invented first is not accurate.\n\nWhen asked why a patent filed after another was the first to be approved, the USPTO said via email:\n\nThere could be a couple of reasons for Page's patent being granted first, ranging from the patent examiner having fewer cases or working a bit faster, the invention requiring less back and forth to understand and approve, or Page/his lawyer responding to the examiner's questions faster. Since the technologies are very different, there would be no conflict between the two patents and it therefore would not have mattered which was granted first.\n\n(USPTO)\n\nFurther, there is only anecdotal evidence that Page's device was actually tested and flew , according to Joseph Page, Charles F. Page's grandson. Joseph Page said via email: \"Family history has been consistent with the belief that the airship was flown by my grandfather. He planned to fly the airship in a contest in St. Louis.\" He added: \"I have known about my grandfather's invention my entire life but stopped talking about it because nobody believed the story.\"\n\nJoseph Page credits local historian Michael Wynne with helping to bring his grandfather's story to light. \"Unfortunately, deep-rooted racial bias still exists here and African American history has long been ignored and neglected,\" Wynne said via email. The historian describes himself as the \"unofficial historian of central Louisiana\" and has written over 50 books on the subject. \"It has been literally a fight for me these six and a half years to bring deserving attention to Page and it continues to be a challenge.\"\n\nDespite the struggle to bring Page's story to light in the present, there was some local coverage of his invention at the time. The April 21, 1906, edition of Alexandria, Louisiana's Weekly Town Talk newspaper, featured a story on Page's airship. It read, in part:\n\nCharles F. Page, a colored citizen of Pineville, and a native of that town, aged about 31 years, has for a number of years been engaged in trying to invent an air ship. He first made application for a patent April 24, 1903, and has now scored U.S. patent, which was issued to him April 10, 1906\n\n[ … ]\n\nAfter an examination we feel confident that the invention is one of merit, and many of the ideas brought out by the inventor entirely new, and we believe that with this invention the navigation of the air, in a safe manner, is nearer in sight than it has ever been.\n\nThe article goes on to describe the airship's design, concluding: \"Inventor Page has made a amiable addition to air navigation machines.\"\n\n(Weekly Town Talk, April 21, 1906)\n\nThe profile of a Black inventor in a Louisiana newspaper at this time was notable considering this was an era of explicit racial segregation in the U.S., with laws being in place that would not be overturned until more than 60 years after Page filed his patent.\n\nIn fact, the social climate of the time likely played a role in Page's eventual erasure from aviation history. A historian from the USPTO said via email:\n\nThe structural racism present in Page's daily life absolutely could have had an impact on Page's ability to market his invention. Black inventors during this time frame often faced barriers in obtaining a lawyer, pitching their products to industries that were dominated by white men and receiving fair treatment in court if their patents were challenged. Receiving his patent was a huge accomplishment in and of itself. I would need to do more research to determine what impact this had on Page personally, but it was certainly a major factor in the experience of Black inventors of his time, particularly in the Jim Crow South.\n\n(Daily Town Talk, May 12, 1974)\n\nAccording to Page's family, one way in which the extreme racism of the era impacted the inventor personally was through an incident linked to his attempted submission of the airship prototype to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. According to Page's daughter in a 1974 report in Louisiana's Alexandria Daily Town Talk , the prototype never made it to its destination and was never seen again. The report read:\n\nIt was an invention which might have landed Page's name beside those of the Wrights as a pioneer in aviation, had the strange-looking machine not mysteriously disappeared en route to the St. Louis World's Fair.\n\n\"It was stolen,\" Miss Eva Page, the inventor's daughter, says of the airship. \"After that Papa never built another one.\"\n\n(\"History of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition\")\n\nThis story was repeated by Page's grandson (Eva Page's nephew), who said via email: \"He shipped the airship by train to St. Louis but it never arrived. Speculation has always been that it was stolen or destroyed.\"\n\nIndeed, pages from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair program , available for viewing through the digital library of the University of Missouri, show no record of Page's device among the other airship displays.\n\nIn 2023, Page's hometown of Pineville, Louisiana, honored the inventor's contributions with a historical marker.\n\n\"He should've been recognized 75 years ago,\" Wynne told KALB , a local news station in Alexandria, Louisiana. He elaborated to Snopes via email: \"Like Jesus was not appreciated in his own hometown of Jerusalem, likewise, Page has been ignored.\""

      "article_title": "These Pics Do Not Prove that Fruit of the Loom's Logo Once Had a Cornucopia",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThere has never been a cornucopia in the logo used by underwear and T-shirt manufacturer Fruit of the Loom. Snopes first fact-checked this unexpectedly contentious claim in June 2023 .\n\nWe updated our piece in January 2024 to note the existence of photos that appeared to show Fruit of the Loom products with a cornucopia logo, and we also debunked claims that a Fruit of the Loom patent document described its logo as having a cornucopia.\n\nNow, in this second update, Snopes demonstrates, conclusively, that four images frequently used in online forms and in emails to Snopes as evidence against our conclusion are provable forgeries.\n\nThe Mandela Effect\n\nIf asked to describe underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom's logo from memory, some will invariably say it includes — or at least included at some point in time — a horned bowl known as a cornucopia. This perception is considered a classic example of the Mandela Effect . In basic terms, the Mandela Effect refers to instances of \"collective misremembering\" in which large numbers of people share the same false belief.\n\nThe belief that the Fruit of the Loom logo included a cornucopia is strongly held. A post on Quora captures this viewpoint:\n\nI have a strong opinion about the Fruit of the Loom logo and whether it had a cornucopia or not. I remember seeing a cornucopia in the logo when I was a kid, and I learned what it was from my school. A cornucopia is a horn-shaped basket that is filled with fruits and vegetables, and it symbolizes abundance and prosperity. I think the cornucopia made sense for the Fruit of the Loom brand because it showed that they had a variety of quality products.\n\nAn image of the purported logo is often shared in defense of this claim:\n\nHowever, that is a fabrication, not the actual Fruit of the Loom logo.\n\nThe perception of a cornucopia in the logo goes back decades. The cover art for a 1973 jazz/funk album by Frank Wess, Flute of the Loom, includes a cornucopia-shaped flute, for example. A 1994 piece in a local Florida paper about the actor Samuel Wright, who played Sebastian the Crab in \"The Little Mermaid\" and who also appeared in Fruit of the Loom commercials, repeated the assertion that the logo contained a cornucopia in print:\n\nFor 19 years, Wright made anywhere from 120-140 television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. And he didn't even wear Fruit of the Looms. He wore skimpy bikini briefs. \"My wife is European,\" he says from a hotel room in Tampa.\n\n\"She said (cotton underwear) made me look like an old man.\" Anyhow, Fruit of the Loom's logo was initially a cornucopia swollen with an apple, green grapes, purple grapes, and their green leaves. Wright was the purple grape cluster. And he had to pretend Fruit of the Looms (\"I never found them that comfortable\") were great.\n\nWhile the existence of these commercials is factual, one cannot help but note that nobody played a cornucopia in the actual commercial series referenced in this article:\n\nThe company has, as well, officially weighed in on the claim. On June 26, 2023, the company tweeted an image from a USA Today crossword puzzle that included the clue \"Fruit of the ____ (company that does not, in fact, have a cornucopia in its logo).\" It noted that the \"Mandela Effect is real\" but that the cornucopia claims were false:\n\nThe Mandela Effect is real, the cornucopia in our logo is not ? pic.twitter.com/qoiuvemsIy\n\n— Fruit of the Loom (@FruitOfTheLoom) June 26, 2023\n\nThe Fruit of the Loom logo has always contained an apple, green grapes, purple grapes, and leaves. Snopes searched archived newspaper advertisements from every decade from the 1910s to the 2020s and could not locate a single one with a cornucopia:\n\n(Snopes.com)\n\nFollowing our original publication of this piece, Snopes received emails and other messages purporting to show evidence missed by Snopes proving that a cornucopia had once been an element in the Fruit of the Loom logo. In broad terms, these arguments boil down to the claim that there are photographs that show Fruit of the Loom shirts with a logo that includes a cornucopia, and that legal filings related to its trademark describe that company's logo as including a cornucopia.\n\nThese arguments hold water about as well as a wicker cornucopia would hold water.\n\nThe Patent\n\nThe legal argument presented in emails to Snopes, and also proffered on Reddit , is that, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Fruit of the Loom itself described its trademark as containing a cornucopia.\n\nThis misconception stems from the fact that at least one trademark registration document apparently filed by Fruit of the Loom used what is known as design search code 05.09.14 to describe the trademark — indicating an image with \"Baskets of fruit; Containers of fruit; [or] Cornucopia (horn of plenty).\" Reddit posts posit that this document has some legal bearing in the world of intellectual property law.\n\nFirst, this is not the case. The primary goal of these search codes, according to the USPTO, is to identify the most \" significant \" visual design elements as an aid for prospective applications to search for similar trademarks. While Snopes has no insight into the legal decisions made by Fruit of the Loom in the 1970s, the 05.09.14 example of a cornucopia contained in the USPTO database classification manual does share some visual similarity with the Fruit of the Loom logo at issue:\n\nSecond, and more to the point, this document is irrelevant. Filed in 1973, the corporate contact was listed as an office in Manhattan. The application itself was rejected by the USPTO. Whatever this document is, it does not represent the active Fruit of the Loom trademark application. The USPTO challenged the cornucopia-containing application in 1980, apparently rejecting it on clerical grounds. The application was officially canceled in 1988.\n\nThe active trademark registration, filed in 1981, lists Fruit of the Loom's Kentucky office as its contact and, crucially, does not use database search code 05.09.14. Instead, codes for several other non-cornucopia visual elements are included:\n\n05.03.08 - More than one leaf, including scattered leaves, bunches of leaves not attached to branches\n\n05.03.25 - Leaf, single; Other leaves\n\n05.09.02 - Grapes\n\n05.09.05 - Apples\n\n05.09.06 - Avocados; Fruits with pits (apricots, peaches, plums, olives and the like)\n\n26.03.02 - Ovals, plain single line; Plain single line ovals\n\nBecause the document cited in support of the legal argument that Fruit of the Loom's logo once contained a cornucopia is a failed patent application that was replaced, or superseded, by an application that contained no descriptors of a cornucopia or cornucopia-related images, it also fails as evidence in support of a cornu-cover-up.\n\nThe Photos\n\nThe most common set of claims that inundate Snopes' inbox concern images of products or advertisements on which a cornucopia-containing Fruit of the Loom logo purportedly appears. Despite the large volume of email, all of these claims rests on only four individual items or locations:\n\nClockwise from the top left are: a black T-shirt appearing to show a cornucopia logo that appears to have its origins in a June 2023 post in the r/funny subreddit; a white T-shirt featured in a TikTok video that described the supposed cover-up of Fruit of the Loom's alleged past use of a cornucopia as \"one of the greatest marketing ploys in history\"; a building with a curved roof that shows several clothing brand logos; and a collection of socks allegedly found in a Colombian supermarket.\n\nThese images are provable forgeries. To understand why, a brief history of fake Fruit of the Loom logos in common circulation is required. There are two widely used designs of a cornucopia-bearing Fruit of the Loom logo. Crucially, both of them were created as intentional fakes for the purpose of demonstrate the Mandela Effect.\n\nThe most prominent design is the one shown at the top of this article. The earliest example Snopes has identified was shared to imgur in February 2017 . The image received widespread exposure later, when it was used in a November 2019 BuzzFeed quiz titled \"You've Seen These Logos A Million Times, But I Bet This Mandela Effect Quiz Still Trips You Up.\" In that case, the cornucopia logo image is used as the incorrect answer.\n\nA second widely shared design was actually created by Fruit of the Loom itself — a fact sometimes misrepresented as evidence to support the claim that the logo once contained a cornucopia. The design comes from an April 1, 2022, archive of Fruit of the Loom's website. Astute readers will note, however, that this date is April Fools' Day. Indeed, the bit was included in PR Daily's roundup of the \"best and worst brand pranks\" of April Fool's Day 2022:\n\nFruit of the Loom's logo always featured a cornucopia behind a variety of tasty fruits …. Right? Nope. That's your alternate universe self talking. But the brand took advantage of the common misconception this April Fools' Day with a subtle update to its logo…\n\nBoth of the two designs used elements of the real Fruit of the Loom logo, with differently shaped and shaded cornucopias added in. As shown below, Snopes refers to these images as the Imgur Fake and the April Fools' Fake (below):\n\nAny photograph displaying either of these designs on a product or building cannot be legitimate, because the designs they feature were created with the intent to be recognized as fake — either as a joke about, or as an illustration of, the Mandela Effect. A photo that uses graphics created to demonstrate the Mandela Effect cannot be presented as evidence against the Mandela Effect.\n\nTo test if these fake designs were used in all four photos, Snopes overlaid the designs on the purported photographs with matching perspective and distortion adjustments to see if they matched. Each of the four images at issue does, in fact, use one of these two fake designs.\n\nThe black T-shirt photo used the April Fools' Fake. The white T-shirt photo used the Imgur Fake:\n\nThe logo displayed on the collection of socks at the Colombian supermarket is also the Imgur Fake:\n\nThe store with the curved roof makes use of the Imgur Fake, as well:\n\nWhether these designs were physically added to the shirts, socks, and/or building, or photoshopped in after the fact, is irrelevant to the debate about the history of the Fruit of the Loom logo.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFruit of the Loom is on the record as stating that their company's logo has never contained a cornucopia. Snopes' review of a century of newspaper ads lacking any cornucopia supports their statement.\n\nA patent document cited in support of the legal argument that Fruit of the Loom's logo once contained a cornucopia was a failed application that was replaced, or superseded, by an application that contained no descriptors of a cornucopia or cornucopia-related images.\n\nEvery image Snopes is aware of that purports to show otherwise makes use of one of two widely acknowledged fake designs created to demonstrate the Mandela effect.\n\nBecause no verified image of a Fruit of the Loom containing a cornucopia exists in print, and because the company has officially stated that its logo has never contained a cornucopia, the claim is False.\n\nThere will likely be more purported photos of products containing these logos in the future. The Imgur Fake, in particular, has reached meme status — and as a result you can buy actual products with that fake logo on sites like Redbubble."

One popular posting was shared by Macon, Georgia, sports anchor Marvin James on Twitter with the following caption: \"I was today years old when I found out the bottom of a Gatorade frost bottle is made to hold the cap\":\n\nI was today years old when I found out the bottom of a Gatorade frost bottle is made to hold the cap ? pic.twitter.com/gOSsdn6bpb\n\n— Marvin James (@sportsguymarv) August 15, 2018\n\nAlthough the bottom of some of the company's bottles may be able to hold their caps in some parts of the world -- Gatorade is a global company and offers products packaged in a variety of shapes and sizes -- there's no evidence that the company purposefully designed this feature into their bottles.\n\nFor one, we were unable to find any marketing material touting this design feature. We also examined various patents covering the design of the Gatorade bottle and found no mention of an underside lid holder. A patent covering the design of Gatorade's 20-oz. sports bottle filed in 1997 by Stokely Van Camp , the beverage's original distributor, makes no mention of any intended cap holder in the bottom of the bottle:\n\nFIG. 3 is a left side elevation, the right side elevation is the same except for the conventional Screw threading on the neck; FIG. 4 is a top view the bottle depicted in FIG. 2; FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the bottle depicted FIG. 2;\n\nA similarly featureless bottom can be spotted on the patent for the 24-oz. bottle.\n\nWe reached out to Gatorade for comment on this supposed design feature, and a company spokesperson told us that \"I have confirmed that this image has been altered, so we're sad to say there is currently no handy cap holder under a Gatorade bottle.\"\n\nAlthough we're not certain if the viral image was actually altered, it seems clear that Gatorade did not design the bottom of their bottles to provide a handy holding place for their caps."

      "article_title": "Government Buries Weather Modification News?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Public Works (DPW) placed classified ads in the Pasadena Star News in early 2016 notifying locals about upcoming cloud seeding equipment installations.\n\nThe only way residents could learn of the program was via a hard to find classified ad; the media ignored the announcement; cloud seeding is a shadowy and sinister form of weather modification somehow linked to chemtrails.\n\nOn 12 March 2016, the web site Wakeup World (described as news pertaining to the \"energetic organism we call Earth, the Universe and the Multiverse\") published a blog post claiming the American government \"quietly\" admitted to engaging in \"weather modification\" activities in a notice buried in the classifieds section of a small California newspaper:\n\n... the level of propaganda and indoctrination that the average American must wade through in order to get the smallest amount of Truth is staggering. We have reached a point in which Americans are so overwhelmed with the current battle taking place between the Alternative News community and mainstream media, and its barrage of contradicting \"Facts,\" that most have simply chosen to completely remove themselves from any critical thinking. Even when the government itself reveals an age-old lie to be true, most are so indoctrinated with the idea of the \"conspiracy\" that they convince themselves that the revelation is just another trick of those deceptive \"conspiracy theorists.\" ... A perfect example of this is weather modification.\n\nWeather modification, geoengineering, chemtrails; these are all topics that if brought up in most circles today, would garner the speaker the telltale look that most Truthers have become all too familiar with. It is a look that has been ingrained into all who have opted to cast aside their critical thinking for their comforting daily lie. There is a herd mentality that has been established that causes even those on the fence or those interested in \"outside the box\" ideas, to fall in line while surrounded by the docile mass. So when the government recently released a \"Notice of Intent\" on page 11 of the Pasadena Star Classifieds, announcing their plan to carry out weather modification in Los Angeles County, it became clear that those blank stares should be turned inward, for some much needed self-reflection and re-evaluation.\n\nThe post included photographs of early 2016 classified ads placed by Los Angeles County's Department of Public Works (DPW) in the Pasadena Star News :\n\nThe blog went on to assert that the odd venue for announcement was clearly an attempt to bury the information from the public, particularly sharper folks who'd kept an eye on such developments over the years:\n\nObviously the appropriate area of the paper to release such a controversial topic is the classifieds, where it will no doubt be noticed by all. Sarcasm aside, it is clear they did not want anyone to take notice of this declaration of weather manipulation that has been fervently denied up until last year.\n\nHowever, the Los Angeles DPW devoted an entire page to the activity (cloud seeding) mentioned in the classified advertisement [ PDF ]. That document explained cloud seeding was an anti-drought measure practiced intermittently for more than half a century in Los Angeles:\n\nYes, since in the 1950's the County of Los Angeles has conducted cloud seeding activities in order to augment local water supplies. When there is abundant rain or major fires affect the targeted watersheds, cloud seeding is temporarily halted.\n\nPublic Works last had a cloud seeding contract in 2009 with North American Weather Consultants, Incorporated.\n\nAlso addressed was the classified ad, which was not new in 2016:\n\nA Public Notice of the Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration (DMND) was published in the Los Angeles Daily News, Los Angeles Times, Pasadena Star News, and San Gabriel Valley Tribune newspapers on July 24, 2009. Copies of the DMND were also sent to 8 cities and 11 local libraries ... A Notice of Intent was published in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Pasadena Star, and Los Angeles Daily newspapers from January 22 through February 5, 2016.\n\nThe FAQ also discussed concerns about safety and chemtrails, noting that data was collected on cloud seeding from the 1950s onward. Regarding chemtrails, the DPW said:\n\nThere is no evidence of any connection between cloud seeding and chemical trails (chemtrails). Atmospheric scientists use the term \"contrails\" which are defined as trails of condensed water vapor created by an engine at high altitudes. These trails are the result of normal emissions of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and some carbon-containing particulates. Contrails are normally observed on otherwise clear days, when cloud seeding would not be conducted. Cloud seeding sources do not produce such visible clouds.\n\nPer the original blog post (which gained additional traction via the unreliable Facebook page \"The Mind Unleashed\"), government officials sought to hide the cloud seeding initiative by placing news of it in a single classified ads section. However, the DPW stated that the same ad appeared in multiple Los Angeles-area newspapers.\n\nFirst, the story wasn't restricted to the classifieds. On the same date the blog post was published warning of this secret classifieds-only initiative CBS News covered cloud seeding in Los Angeles, as did KNSD and Gizmodo (on 9 March 2016); The Weather Channel (on 10 March 2016) KCAL (on 11 March 2016); and the Los Angeles Times (all the way back on 8 March 2016).\n\nMoreover, the claim that the government \"fervently\" denied such programs until the 2016 classified ad appeared was easily proved false. The National Center for Atmospheric Research and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (NCAR and UCAR) published a fact sheet in 2008 , Scientific American and U.S. News and World Report covered cloud seeding in 2009 , ABC News reported on it way back in 2002 , and the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) released a fact sheet in 2001 . It would be difficult for anyone with a consistent interest in cloud seeding to miss news and information published widely over the years; the conspiracy's core claims relied on an audience that was to-date unfamiliar with the practice wholesale.\n\nSo while it was true Los Angeles' DPW announced cloud seeding plans via classified ads in early 2016, the disclosure was neither \"quiet\" nor novel in 2016; cloud seeding in the area occurred intermittently and openly beginning in the 1950s. Moreover, the 12 March 2016 blog post claiming that the program was a subtle admission (validating long-held suspicions) neglected to mention widespread media coverage across several high-profile sites in the days prior to its publication. Focusing on one of several classified ads provided the inaccurate impression that the program was largely secretive in nature, but information was easily obtained via both the DPW's web site and in contemporaneous news coverage."

      "article_title": "Henry Ford Built a Car with Exterior Made of Soybean Plastic in the 1940s?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThere is no record of the exact formula Ford used to make the plastic components of the automobile. Contemporaneous sources claimed that in addition to soybeans, it was composed of other agricultural crops such as hemp, wheat and flax. One newspaper described the vehicle as \"part salad and part automobile.\"\n\nThat the founder of Ford Motor Co., Henry Ford, invented a vehicle made of soybean-based plastic in the 1940s is a claim that has permeated corners of social media for more than a decade . From posts shared to Instagram in 2024 to photos on Facebook in 2018, Snopes found evidence of this claim existing in dozens of iterations across the web, including the below post shared to Reddit in 2020:\n\nSnopes determined that the above image is genuine. However, according to The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation , no record of the product's plastic formula exists. As such, the exact ingredients of the vehicle are unknown.\n\nThat being said, the book \" Henry Ford and his Researchers: History of their Work with Soybeans, Soyfoods and Chemurgy \" outlines Ford's soybean research between 1928 and 2011, with references to various newspaper articles and other contemporaneous sources. Based on this information, we've rated this claim as \"True.\"\n\nFor example:\n\nAt 2,000 pounds — half the weight of a steel-bodied car at the time — the soybean car comprised 14 plastic panels attached to a tubular steel frame. The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation notes that the \"exact ingredients of the plastic panels are unknown because no record of the formula exists today.\"\n\n(The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation)\n\nA 1988 article titled \"Henry's Plastic Car: An Interview with Mr. Lowell E. Overly,\" published in the 2017 book \" History of Industrial Uses of Soybeans ,\" identified Overly as the \"designer of the world's first plastic car.\" Overly worked at the Soybean Laboratory at Greenfield Village in Michigan, a lab established by Ford in 1929 to conduct chemical research on farm products. According to the interview:\n\nHenry Ford was interested in finding new industrial uses for farm products and by 1931 he had settled on soybeans as having the most promise… Sometime in late 1937 or early 1938 large sheets of soybean plastic were made and Mr. Ford was so proud of it that he would jump up and down on it and brag to reporters or anybody else that happened to be around…\n\nLater a rear deck-lid made from the plastic was fitted to Mr. Ford's car and he delighted in sitting it with an axe [ax] that he carried in the truck. However, Mr. Overlay recalls that the first time Mr. Ford struck it with an axe the deck lid cracked and the axe head went through it. Later, glass fibre was mixed into the plastic and the further precaution of a rubber boot was affixed to the sharp edge of the axe. The rebound would cause the ax to fly out of Mr. Ford's hands and gravel about fifteen feet before coming to rest. Satisfied with these results Mr. Ford gave orders to develop a small car with a plastic body.\n\nThe car had a tubular steel frame. The body panels were made of plastic composed of soybean fiber in a phenolic resin with formaldehyde used in the pregnation.\n\nThe Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation noted that the soybean car was unveiled at the annual Dearborn Days celebration on Aug. 13, 1941, and then trucked to the Michigan State Fairgrounds.\n\n\"By the end of the war the idea of a plastic car had fallen through the cracks due to energy being directed towards war recovery efforts,\" wrote the museum.\n\nSnopes cross-referenced a patent number cited on a Wikipedia page describing the soybean car with Google Patents , and found patent number US2269452A, which described a \"chassis frame on which a vehicle body may be mounted built up with interlaced cross members.\" It was filed by Ford and Gregorie Eugene on July 27, 1940, and was granted on Jan. 13, 1942. However, the patent did not make any reference to \"soybean\" or \"plastic.\"\n\n(Google Patents)"

      "article_title": "Hepatitis C Treatment Highlights Disparity in Worldwide Drug Prices",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe United States pays significantly more for health care than any other country in the world.\n\nThe high cost isn't entirely due to corporate greed and Big Pharma owning U.S. politicians.\n\nThe high cost of medications in the United States has been a major topic of discussion since well before President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010.  While it is possible to get extraordinarily good health care in the U.S., the price of such care — or any care — is often prohibitive, often far more than in any other developed country.\n\nHepatitis C is a virus that can cause progressive liver damage, and also increases the likelihood of developing liver cancer or cirrhosis. Because it is a bloodborne illness, hepatitis C often spread through sharing needles or receiving blood transfusions. Until very recently, the disease had no cure.\n\nEnter Gilead Sciences, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that developed a pill called sofosbuvir (brand name: Sovaldi), which completely cures the disease over a twelve-week period.  It is more effective when combined with a newer drug, ledivaspir, to make a cocktail patented as Harvoni .\n\nThe treatment is hailed as a miracle drug, especially in parts of India that are dramatically affected by hepatitis, commonly spread there (as in other developing countries) by tainted needles used and re-used for injections and transfusions and exacerbated by impoverished and cramped living conditions.\n\nWhen Gilead began to market Sovaldi in 2013, it set the price at $1,000 per pill and $84,000 for a full course of treatment — at least, in the United States.  Because Gilead entered a series of marketing agreements with generic drug companies in India, and because India is extremely strict in limiting what can and cannot be legally patented there, a month's worth of sofosbuvir treatment initially retailed there for the equivalent of USD$300 (or, as the meme says, $900 for the full course of treatment; the cost of treatment further dropped over time to about $4 a pill). Patents guarantee exclusive sales for at least a decade in the United States before competition from generic drugs is allowed.\n\nThis was excellent news for the estimated 12 to 18 million people who suffer from chronic hepatitis C in India , but a terrible blow to many of the 3.5 million sufferers in the U.S. to whom the far higher costs were prohibitive.\n\nBut while it is true that the price of this miracle treatment is eye-poppingly higher in the United States than it is in India (or just about anywhere else in the world), it's reductive to say that this is simply the end result of Big Pharma owning American politicians.  There are several other reasons that drug prices are an estimated two to six times higher in the United States than they are in any other country.  The Wall Street Journal found during the course of a 2015 investigative piece about drug pricing that the domestic market is rife with secret deals, shadowy middlemen, and trade secrets:\n\nBut for certain drugs—those paid for by Medicare Part B—prices are public. By stacking these against pricing in three foreign health systems, as discovered in nonpublic and public data, The Wall Street Journal was able to pinpoint international drug-cost differences and what lies behind them.\n\nWhat it found, in the case of Norway, was that U.S. prices were higher for 93% of 40 top branded drugs available in both countries in the third quarter. Similar patterns appeared when U.S. prices were compared with those in England and Canada's Ontario province. Throughout the developed world, branded prescription drugs are generally cheaper than in the U.S.\n\nThe upshot is Americans fund much of the global drug industry's earnings, and its efforts to find new medicines. \"The U.S. is responsible for the majority of profits for most large pharmaceutical companies,\" said Richard Evans, a health-care analyst at SSR LLC and a former pricing official at drug maker Roche Holding AG.\n\nThe reasons the U.S. pays more are rooted in philosophical and practical differences in the way its health system provides benefits, in the drug industry's political clout and in many Americans' deep aversion to the notion of rationing.\n\nThe United States' pricing is as much a matter of the American culture of individualism as it is an issue of big pharmaceutical companies' greed.  In other countries, the state-run health systems do research and negotiations with drug companies directly, often completely refusing to buy drugs in bulk if the prices are too high or the treatments too precarious.  Because the medical care is state-run (control that many Americans are unwilling to hand over to the United States government), the state is effectively the only large buyer for drugs in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, in the United States, there is no central state-run health care. Even now, in the Affordable Care Act era, the market is splintered and multi-tiered.  There are large state-run entities like Medicare, true, but there are also individuals, municipalities, states, and regional entities that are negotiating with drug companies, which does nothing to drive down the prices of drugs in bulk.\n\nBut higher drug prices in the United States aren't just a function of greed. According to health care analysts, American drug costs go a long way toward funding biopharmaceutical research and development, which allows innovation to flourish.  A 2012 brief published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services examined the costs and benefits of medical and pharmaceutical innovation:\n\nIn the health care market, where consumers frequently do not directly pay for their health care, products may be purchased whose price exceeds the consumer's true willingness to pay leading to over-investment in innovation. Also, developers may innovate by developing pharmaceuticals that do not offer benefits beyond what is already on the market to gain market share. This innovation for \"business stealing\" may make society worse off, as the fixed costs of development are incurred, but there is no improvement in health outcomes.\n\nOn average, research suggests that additional innovation is welfare enhancing. Lakdawalla et al. looked at the welfare impacts (health and medical spending) of lowering U.S. prices to E.U. levels. They constructed a 5 step microsimulation model that 1) calculated new drugs introductions based on new molecular entities mapped to seven diseases, 2) identified the top-selling drugs, 3) estimated health effects of top-selling drugs based on clinical trial results, 4) estimated effects of changes in revenue on innovation, and 5) mapped health status and health care use. They found that price controls have modest benefits in the short run and substantial costs in the long run. Alternatively, reductions in co-payments increased utilization, increased revenues, and innovation benefitting current and future generations. Scherer critiqued their model on several points. One, the estimate for the impact of changes in revenues on innovation was based on Acemoglu and Linn's estimate, which Scherer believes is too high and was calculated based on population counts, not revenues. Two, the authors limited the model to blockbuster drugs which earn extraordinary profits and so would still be likely to be developed even with lower revenue expectations.\n\nThe challenge in the U.S., then, seems to be weighing the benefits of innovation with the drawbacks of having state-of-the-art treatments that are too expensive for anyone but the very rich to be able to afford.\n\nBut to return to Gilead and the case of the hepatitis C cure: its sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni has been incredibly lucrative for the company.   However, in March 2016, a federal jury in California ordered the company to pay $200 million to Merck, a competing pharmaceutical company that recently released its own hepatitis C treatment , on the grounds that Gilead illegally used Merck's patents to develop sofosbuvir.  (Merck was asking for ten percent of Gilead's profits through 2015 in damages, plus royalties from all U.S. sales.)  In May 2016, a federal judge reopened the case after discovering that a key witness misrepresented himself as a scientist, and then lied to the jury about claims that he was responsible for developing the drugs for Merck.\n\nOn 6 June 2016, a federal judge overturned the $200 million jury award and threw out the March 2016 patent infringement judgment that Merck had won against Gilead Sciences, Inc.  The judge was scathing in the court document:\n\nCandor and honesty define the contours of the legal system. When a company allows and supports its own attorney to violate these principles, it shares the consequences of those actions. Here, Merck's patent attorney, responsible for prosecuting the patents-in-suit, was dishonest and duplicitous in his actions with Pharmasset, with Gilead and with this Court, thus crossing the line to egregious misconduct. Merck is guilty of unclean hands and forfeits its right to prosecute this action against Gilead.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Merck is barred from asserting the '499 and '712 Patents against Gilead and Merck shall take nothing by this suit.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilead is working on yet another new treatment for hepatitis.  This means that while the prices of treatments for the viruses that cause various forms of hepatitis may soon go down in the United States, although it's unlikely that the prices will fall as low as $4 a pill (or even $10 a pill) any time soon."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe most famous of the all people aboard the Titanic for her one and only voyage was unquestionably John Jacob Astor. The multimillionaire heir of a vast fur trading and real estate fortune owned some of the world's most expensive properties, including New York's Astoria Hotel. He once purportedly quipped that \"a man who has a million dollars is almost as well off as if he were wealthy.\"\n\nIn Walter Lord's book , \"A Night to Remember,\" he noted of Astor's fame, \"After [the Titanic] sank, the New York American broke the news on April 16 with a lead devoted almost entirely to John Jacob Astor; at the end it mentioned that 1,800 others were also lost.\"\n\nBesides being fabulously wealthy, Astor was also what we now might term \"a bit eccentric.\" He tinkered with various inventions and held several patents, wrote a science fiction novel, and once loaded a coach on his private railway with millionaires so he could pull it with his locomotive — just so he could say he'd done it.\n\nAstor's combination of fame and eccentricity, and perhaps a reputation for being a bit humorless, made him the perfect person to whom to attribute this bon mot, but this legend is unlikely as a true anecdote.\n\nAccording to the rumor, Astor was standing at the bar after the Titanic's collision with the iceberg and supposedly said, \"I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.\" However, no survivor reported actually having heard Astor say this. Further, the millionaire wasn't on deck or in one of the ship's lounges when the Titanic struck the iceberg. Astor was, according to Lord, in his cabin with his pregnant young wife:\n\nJohn Jacob Astor seemed equally unperturbed. Returning to his suite after going up to investigate, he explained to Mrs. Astor that the ship had struck ice, but it didn't look serious.\n\nWhen the Titanic 's starboard side collided with a large iceberg that fateful night, chunks of ice came raining down onto its forward well deck and, until the seriousness of the situation as made known, at least, served as a great source of amusement to some of the passengers who were still awake or came out of their cabins to see what was the matter.\n\nNo doubt at least a few of them made jokes about ice, and the connection between drinks and ice is an obvious one. In fact, one of the Titanic's survivors, Lawrence Beesley, in his account of the sinking published later that year, claimed he overheard a similar quip:\n\nOne of the [card] players [in the Second Class smoking room], pointing to his glass of whiskey standing at his elbow, and turning to an onlooker, said, \"Just run along the deck and see if any ice has come aboard: I would like some for this.\"\n\nWhether Beesley related something he had actually witnessed or simply repeated a good joke he heard after the fact, that he didn't attribute it to Astor is significant. Perhaps someone aboard the Titanic that night did make this joke, but it wasn't Astor."

      "article_title": "Scientist Sold Insulin Patent for $1, Saying 'It Belongs to the World'?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nCanadian scientist Frederick Banting and his co-discoverers of insulin sold their patent to the University of Toronto for $1 in a deal that was finalized in 1923.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Banting ever said “Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world.”\n\nOn June 12, 2024, a Reddit post on the r/BeAmazed subreddit claimed that, in January 1923, Frederick Banting sold his insulin patent for $1, saying, \"Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world.\" As of this writing, the post has received around 23,000 upvotes.\n\nThe alleged quote has circulated widely for years. The World Health Organization's Facebook page shared an image featuring it on June 11, 2024. U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, posted an abridged version on X in 2019. The quote also appears in a number of published books and scholarly journal articles .\n\nDespite the quote's prevalence across different types of media, Snopes found no evidence that Banting, the Canadian scientist who won a Nobel Prize for discovering insulin, ever said it. However, it is true that Banting and two colleagues sold their patent for the lifesaving drug for just $1 in 1923. As such, we rate this claim a \"Mixture\" of truth and falsity.\n\nThe original source for the quote appears to be a children's biography of Banting titled \"The Discoverer of Insulin: Dr. Frederick Banting,\" written by I.E. Levine and published in 1959, 18 years after Banting died in a plane crash. Neither the quote nor any variation thereof appears in any of the sources cited in the bibliography at the end of the book.\n\nThe quote also does not appear in any of the biographies of Banting written for adults, such as Michael Bliss's acclaimed \" Banting: A Biography ,\" or in any legitimate media coverage of Banting from either before or after his death. As such, the likeliest explanation for the origin of the quote is that Levine, the author of biographical books for children, used artistic license to imagine something Banting might have said.\n\nThe details of Banting's sale of the patent for insulin, on the other hand, are well-documented and can be substantiated.\n\nThe patent's buyer, the University of Toronto, has made digital scans of the original patent assignment document available online. The amount the University of Toronto paid Banting and his colleagues Charles Herbert Best and James Bertram Collip for the patent, $1, is clearly noted on the document's first full page.\n\n(University of Toronto Libraries)\n\nEagle-eyed readers might note that the assignment document is dated Dec. 19, 1922, not 1923. The document's cover sheet explains why 1923 is the year typically given for the sale: The transfer of the patent from Banting and his colleagues to the University of Toronto was not formally recorded in the Ottawa Patent and Copyright Office until Jan. 1, 1923, so the patent technically remained in the three scientists' names until then.\n\nAccording to the Bank of Canada's Inflation Calculator , that $1 in 1923 would be worth around 17.46 Canadian dollars ($12.70) in 2024 — a substantial increase in terms of percent change, but still a remarkably low price for the patent for a drug of critical importance.\n\nWhat about the reason Banting and his colleagues decided to sell the insulin patent for so little money? In an article published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2021, diabetes researchers Gary F. Lewis and Patricia L. Brubaker explained the rationale for the sale, which was more complicated than the simple altruism suggested by memes about Banting.\n\nIn short, the sale was part of a larger agreement between the scientists, the University of Toronto and U.S. drug company Eli Lilly intended to ramp up production of the drug in order to meet demand as quickly as possible. As part of the terms of the agreement, Eli Lilly committed to licensing insulin from the University of Toronto and manufacturing and distributing the drug free of charge to certain hospitals for one year.\n\nAfter that year, Eli Lilly was left with an effective monopoly on U.S. rights to the drug, which it was legally free to profit from. According to Lewis and Brubaker, in the first year the company was allowed to charge for the drug, Eli Lilly brought in more than $1 million, equivalent to around $18.4 million in 2024, from insulin sales alone. In other words, although Banting did not make a direct profit from insulin sales, the drug became highly profitable for Eli Lilly as a result of the terms of the sale.\n\nEli Lilly remains one of the three main suppliers of insulin in the U.S., with the others being Sanofi and Novo Nordisk. Following price caps announced in 2023, Eli Lilly and Sanofi now charge a maximum out-of-pocket price of $35 a month for the most widely prescribed form of insulin. Novo Nordisk has also implemented programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs for diabetes patients.\n\nBefore the implementation of U.S. price caps, however, American insulin prices far surpassed those in other countries. In a study comparing insulin prices in the U.S. with those in other countries, the RAND Corp. found that in October 2019 the average U.S. price per standard unit of the drug was $98.70, compared with $7.52 in the U.K., $9.08 in France and $12 in Canada.\n\nIn summary, it is true that Banting and his insulin co-discoverers sold their patent for the drug to the University of Toronto for $1 in a sale that was finalized in 1923. However, there is no evidence that Banting ever said \"Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world,\" despite the widespread appearance of the quote on social media and elsewhere. Additionally, although the 1923 sale of the insulin patent significantly sped up the availability of the drug worldwide, it did not directly result in universally affordable insulin prices."

      "article_title": "Story about Tabitha Babbitt inventing 'first practical' circular sawmill is probably not true",
      "text": "According to a rumor that has circulated online for years, Tabitha Babbitt, a Shaker woman from Massachusetts, created the \" first practical circular sawmill \" in the early 19th century. The story of Babbitt's supposed invention appears in numerous social media posts on platforms including Instagram , X and Reddit as well as on hundreds of websites .\n\nOne such iteration appeared ( archived ) in a March 20, 2025, Facebook post that claimed Babbitt \"revolutionized woodworking in 1810.\" That post, which had around 139,000 reactions at the time of this writing, read:\n\nTabitha Babbitt, a Shaker woman and skilled inventor, revolutionized woodworking in 1810 by creating the first practical circular sawmill.\n\nObserving how traditional saws wasted energy with their inefficient back-and-forth motion, she devised a smarter solution. Inspired by her spinning wheel, she attached a circular blade, enabling continuous cutting with less effort.\n\nThough Shaker beliefs prevented her from patenting the invention, her idea laid the groundwork for modern sawmill technology. Babbitt's innovation not only improved efficiency in lumber processing but also contributed to industrial advancements in woodworking. Her work remains a testament to the ingenuity of women in early technology, despite historical recognition often favoring male inventors.\n\nToday, the circular saw remains a crucial tool in construction and carpentry, proving the lasting impact of her design. Tabitha Babbitt's pioneering spirit continues to inspire, reminding us that necessity and observation can lead to groundbreaking innovation.\n\nThe story appears in the book \" Women of Invention: Life-Changing Ideas by Remarkable Women \" and in a 2015 op-ed that ran in the Portsmouth Herald and argued that Babbitt \"belongs in Inventors Hall of Fame\" for her alleged creation.\n\nHowever, experts say this story is likely not true.\n\n\"The short answer is that the Babbitt story is most likely apocryphal,\" said Dana Rasso of the Shaker Museum in Chatham, New York, although she noted that \"the Shakers have a number of patents and were known for their ingenuity. Tabitha Babbitt herself was a prolific creator.\"\n\nRasso said in an email that she suspects the story originated in the 1916 book \" Gleanings from Old Shaker Journals ,\" compiled by Clara Endicott Sears. On Page 348, Sears described Babbitt as a \"clever, talented woman, and an inventor, too.\" Sears, a \"resident of Harvard,\" Massachusetts, wrote the following account of Babbitt:\n\nOne day as she was spinning, she noticed the brethren sawing wood in the old-fashioned way; she observed that one half of the motion was lost, and so conceived the idea of a circular saw. She made a tin disc, notched it round the edge, slipped it on the spindle of her wheel, tried it on a piece of shingle, found it would cut, and gave to the world the buzz-saw. The first circular saw made under her instructions is on exhibition in the Geological Building at Albany, New York.\n\nHistorian Christian Goodwillie demonstrated why this story was likely untrue in an article outlining the known history of the circular saw that appeared in the 2010 book \"Inspired Innovations: A Celebration of Shaker Integrity.\" Goodwillie noted that the above account first appeared verbatim in the Shaker periodical The Manifesto in February 1899.\n\nGoodwillie continued by stating that it was \"unlikely that the Shakers invented the circular saw, despite numerous Shaker and non-Shaker printed claims.\" Although the Shakers were probably not the first to use the circular saw, Goodwillie added, they were \"certainly early proponents\" of the technology.\n\n\"As with many other important inventions in history, the circumstances surrounding the development of the circular saw are unclear,\" he wrote.\n\nBabbitt (whose last name is spelled \"Babbit\" in some sources) was born in Hardwick, Massachusetts, on Dec. 10, 1779, and was admitted to the Harvard Shaker community at 13 years old, Goodwillie wrote, adding:\n\nThe information about her invention was first published in the Boston Sunday Globe for October 30, 1898, as part of an article on Harvard Eldress Eliza Babbitt. Obviously, the Harvard Shakers supplied the information, but since Tabitha Babbitt had died in 1853, it could not be verified. The case for Babbitt as inventor was re-told by Anna While and Leila S. Taylor in their history \"Shakerism: Its Meaning and Message.\" This reference has somehow found its way into countless other works on the Shakers, their inventions, and the history of technology in general.\n\nWhere does all of this leave us? It is safe to say that the Shakers did not invent the circular saw, but they do appear to be among its earliest users and may have created new forms and uses for it. Too often, proven Shaker innovation is marginalized in favor of unsubstantiated claims for Shaker invention. This is a disservice to a group whose more than two hundred years of success in this country is a tribute to their ability to alter, adapt, and improve almost every technology they encountered.\n\nThe evidence against Babbitt's supposed invention is robust, according to Goodwillie, who wrote that the first documented patent in an English-speaking country referring to a mill that used \"saws, which are a circular figure\" was granted to a man named Samuel Miller in Southampton, England, in 1777 — two years before Babbitt was born. Miller's patent, however, did not contain much detail about the saws.\n\nGoodwillie also noted that \"smaller, circular metal blades had been used in surgical instruments for many years prior to this date.\"\n\n\"Other than a series of vague references in secondary works on the history of saw technology, there is a dearth of primary source material about circular saws through the rest of the eighteenth century,\" wrote Goodwillie, who confirmed over email that the information in his article reflected the most up-to-date available scholarship on the subject.\n\nGoodwillie also noted that Isaac Newton Youngs documented the history of Shakers in his 1856 book \"A Concise View of the Church of God.\" That book contained no mention of Babbitt inventing the circular sawmill."

      "article_title": "Does Ivanka Trump Hold a Trademark on Coffins in China?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nIvanka Trump's company holds a variety of trademarks in China, including one for coffins.\n\nHowever, this trademark was granted in 2018, well before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Moreover, Ivanka Trump shuttered her business in July 2018 to focus on work for the White House and there is no evidence she is involved in manufacturing or selling coffins in China or elsewhere.\n\nIn April 2020, as the global death toll from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic surpassed 100,000, social media users started to post messages about how Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter and newly appointed member of the White House's council to reopen America, had a trademark in China on coffins:\n\nWhile some shared this claim as if it were a \"fun fact,\" others made a more direct connection between her company's trademark on coffins in China to the rising death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nAccording to multiple news reports, the first daughter's company, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, was truly awarded a trademark on coffins in China. However, this occurred in 2018, long before COVID-19 started to spread around the globe.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in May 2018 that her company had been awarded 13 trademarks in China over three months. These trademarks covered a variety of products, including baby blankets, coffee, perfume, and coffins:\n\nIvanka Trump’s brand continues to win foreign trademarks in China and the Philippines, adding to questions about conflicts of interest at the White House, The Associated Press has found.\n\nOn Sunday, China granted the first daughter’s company final approval for its 13th trademark in the last three months, trademark office records show. Over the same period, the Chinese government has granted Ivanka Trump’s company provisional approval for another eight trademarks, which can be finalized if no objections are raised during a three-month comment period.\n\nTaken together, the trademarks could allow her brand to market a lifetime’s worth of products in China, from baby blankets to coffins, and a host of things in between, including perfume, makeup, bowls, mirrors, furniture, books, coffee, chocolate and honey. Ivanka Trump stepped back from management of her brand and placed its assets in a family-run trust, but she continues to profit from the business.\n\nWhen users in April 2020 re-shared news stories about her trademarks amidst the global pandemic, many insinuated she would be capitalizing off of people's deaths, and that people in China would be required to purchase a Trump coffin. But that's not the case.\n\nThis confusion appears to be based on the conflation of the terms \"trademark\" and \" patent .\" With a trademark, Ivanka Trump has the opportunity to sell products (in this case a coffin) bearing her company's name. A trademark does not give Trump's company any sort of exclusive deal to sell coffins in China. Other companies can still manufacturer and sell coffins just as always.\n\nAustralia's ABC News noted that companies sometimes file for a trademark as part of a \"defensive\" strategy to prevent competitors from squatting on a brand's name:\n\nCompanies register for trademarks for a variety of reasons. They can be a sign of corporate ambition, but in many countries, like China, where trademark squatting is rampant, companies also file defensively, to block copycats from grabbing legal rights to a brand's name.\n\nThis appears to be the strategy of Ivanka Trump's company. Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a May 2018 statement that these trademarks were obtained during the \"normal course of business.\" Klem also noted that trademark infringement was rampant, and that the company was trying to protect its brand:\n\n“The brand has filed, updated, and rigorously protected its international trademarks over the past several years in the normal course of business, especially in regions where trademark infringement is rampant. ... We have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark.”\n\nIt should also be noted that, as Snopes reported in 2019, Ivanka Trump was not running the company at the time that these trademarks were obtained. Ivanka stepped down from day-to-day operations in 2017 and announced that the company was closing down the following year:\n\nIvanka Trump said in a statement announcing the closure:\n\n\"After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington. So making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.\"\n\nWhile Ivanka Trump may have not had a hand in obtaining these trademarks, the government transparency advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) cautioned that these trademarks could still represent a conflict of interest in the future.\n\nCREW wrote :\n\nIvanka announced the immediate closure of her brand in July 2018, citing her official government responsibilities in Washington, DC. However, her trademarks remain a potential conflict of interest as she continues to work on policy in the White House and meet with foreign leaders.\n\nTo sum up: Ivanka Trump's company obtained several trademarks in China in 2018 that covered a wide range of products, including baby blankets, perfume, and coffins. This trademark gives the company the opportunity to sell Trump-branded coffins and prevents other companies from using the Trump brand to sell their own coffins.\n\nAs of this writing, we've seen no reporting that Ivanka Trump's company (which she no longer operates) plans to manufacture or sell coffins in China."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nChina granted trademarks for multiple products, potentially including voting machines, under Ivanka Trump's eponymous brand in late 2018.\n\nIvanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father President Donald Trump, shuttered her business in 2018.\n\nIn early October 2019, reports began circulating that President Trump's eldest daughter Ivanka had secured trademarks for voting machines, among other products, in China. (Update: A similar rumor holding that Ivanka Trump owns a Chinese trademark for coffins emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.)\n\nThere seemed to be little doubt about the veracity of the claim, as substantiated by news reports initially published in November 2018. But social media users began sharing the claim a year later in conjunction with the commencement of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump spearheaded by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nA whistleblower complaint made public in September 2019 accused President Trump of attempting to coerce Ukraine into collecting damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden, Trump's potential rival in the 2020 presidential elecion. In defending himself, Trump and his supporters adopted two narratives.\n\nIn one narrative, Trump and his defenders lobbed unfounded allegations that it was Biden, not Trump, who was guilty of coercing Ukraine by strong-arming that country into firing a prosecutor for investigating a company on which Biden's son held a paid board position. In the other narrative, Trump and his defenders declared that Trump was simply attempting to root out corruption when he leaned on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens:\n\nIn the midst of that scandal, Trump upped the ante by stating on live national television that \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump's critics have latched on to the second defense and his statements about China, pointing to the fact that Trump and his immediate family members currently serving in the White House also have well-documented overseas business interests, including the securing of multiple trademarks for products in China:\n\nIn November 2018, the government transparency advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) published a statement linking to source documents revealing that \"Presidential adviser Ivanka Trump's fashion brand had just won first trial approval for 16 new trademarks (which had been applied for back in 2016) from the Chinese government. These approvals come about three months after Ivanka announced that her brand was shutting down, and mark the largest number of new Chinese trademarks she has received in a single month since President Donald Trump took office.\"\n\nAlthough Ivanka Trump declared in July 2018 that she would be shuttering her namesake clothing brand, CREW stated that the trademarking of Ivanka Trump-branded items in China continues to be ethically problematic:\n\nThe newest Chinese trademarks cover fashion items including handbags, shoes, wedding dresses, and jewelry. (Ivanka's business has previously relied on a Chinese manufacturer to supply handbags, shoes, and clothing.) The trademarks also cover items including nursing homes, sausage casing, and voting machines. Ivanka's business applied for these trademarks in 2016.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Ivanka's Chinese trademarks have raised ethics questions. In May 2018, Ivanka Trump's business received approval for several new Chinese trademarks a week before President Trump announced that he wanted to lift the ban on the Chinese company ZTE, for violating US sanctions. In 2017, the business received three new Chinese trademarks on the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIvanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses.\n\nAlthough Ivanka Trump's now reportedly shut-down brand may hold a variety of trademarks in China, it's unlikely she'll be involved in manufacturing sausage casings, coffins , or voting machines in the foreseeable future."

      "article_title": "Did Jack Johnson Invent the Monkey Wrench?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nBoxer Jack Johnson patented a type of wrench in the 1920s.\n\nJack Johnson did not invent what we now call a \"monkey wrench,\" nor did that term originate as a racial slur.\n\nIn mid-December 2015 a meme that claimed the term \"monkey wrench\" was first used as a derogatory term concerning its African-American inventor Jack Johnson, started circulating online:\n\nWhile the central theme of this meme (that white people used the term \"monkey wrench\" as a racial slur to demean its inventor) is false, the meme does have some truth to it. Jack Johnson was the first African-American world heavyweight boxing champion, and he did patent a type of wrench in 1922. Johnson's patent, however, did not mark the invention of the first adjustable wrench, nor did it spawn the origin of the term \"monkey wrench.\" Johnson's patent was merely an improvement on a previous design and had little bearing on the history of the tool, which can be traced back to the 1840s.\n\nIn February 2005, the Jim Crow Museum published a brief history of the wrench in an attempt to answer a question about Jack Johnson and his 1922 patent:\n\nDid Jack Johnson invent the wrench?\n\nJack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, patented a wrench (U.S. patent #1,413,121) on April 18, 1922. His patent was not the first for a wrench. Solymon Merrick of Springfield, Massachusetts, patented the first wrench in 1835. Charles Moncky, a Baltimore mechanic, invented the monkey wrench around 1858. Moncky's wrench was named using a purposeful misspelling of his name . On September 9, 1913, Robert Owen Jr, of Shawnee, Ohio, received a patent for the \"Double Acting Wrench\" (ratchet wrench), arguably the most important advancement in wrench technology. Daniel C. Stillson, a steamboat firefighter, received a patented on September 13, 1870 for an invention later known as the Stillson pipe wrench.\n\nJack Johnson, the inventor, represents little more than an interesting historical footnote. He owes his fame and infamy to his boxing exploits and his violation of social norms.\n\nALthough the Jim Crow Museum stated that the monkey wrench was named after its inventor, Charles Moncky, not all historians agree. Herb Page, for example, wrote in a 2002 article entitled \"Reach for the Wrench\" in the Fine Tool Journal that Moncky was neither responsible for the tool's invention nor its name, and that the latter stemmed from the wrench's appearance:\n\nOf course, over the years, some speculation indicated that the original inventor, a man named Monk or Monck was responsible for the name. However, this has been refuted by diligent historical and patent research. New England industrial pioneers, Loring Coes and Laurin Trask, around the end of the 19th century related the more plausible account. They indicated that the term \"monkey wrench\" was already in use prior to Coes' early patent (1841) and referred at that time to the earlier English type of adjustable wrench where you turned the handle to adjust the jaws.\n\nI now provide some further evidence to back up Coes and Trask's allegation, in that a wrench labeled \"Monkey Wrench\" was depicted in the English tool catalogue issued by Timmins & Sons, which hails from the early to mid-1840s. Also, I show a very early English wrench from my collection that I reckon to be from about the same or an even earlier era. This item, with its rounded head and \"twist the tail\" (handle) to adjust the mouth feature, could easily inspire the image of a monkey. I conclude that the name came along with these early wrenches when they were shipped to America. This particular wrench is marked \"5. Johnson Sheffield\" with an \"S.J.\" in a flag logo and exhibits the very fine detailed workmanship characteristic of early Sheffield tools.\n\nIn summation, while boxer Jack Johnson did patent a type of wrench in the 1920s, it was not the original monkey wrench. Furthermore, the tool was not named \"monkey wrench\" in an attempt to demean its inventor, as the term \"monkey wrench\" had been in use since at least the 1840s and most likely referred to the tool's original \"twist the tail\" method of adjusting the jaws."

      "text": "A rumor circulating online in August 2024 claimed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said she desired to \"snatch\" up patents so that the U.S. government could take them over.\n\nThe rumor spread on X in an 18-second video clip showing Harris speaking to voters on C-SPAN in Muscatine, Iowa, on Nov. 22, 2019. At the time, Harris — then a U.S. senator from California — was campaigning for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nIn the brief video clip posted ( archived ) by an X user on Aug. 16, Harris said, \"I will snatch their patent, so that we will take over.\" Looking toward the crowd, she continued, \"And yes, we can do that. Yes. Yes, we can do that. Yes, we can do that. The question is, do you have the will to do it? I have the will to do it.\" That X post received millions of views and tens of thousands of reposts and likes.\n\nAs Mediaite reported in its own article about this rumor, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among the thousands of users to repost the clip, captioning his post ( archived ) with, \"Well, this is crazy.\"\n\nIt's true Harris said the words, \"I will snatch their patent, so that we will take over.\" However, the 18-second video clip users shared omitted some context from her remarks.\n\nThe longer video hosted by C-SPAN showed Harris was speaking about patents for prescription drugs, specifically for drugs created by pharmaceutical companies that had received federal funding and, in the future, would refuse to lower consumers' costs to equal amounts charged in other countries. (The bolded words below indicate the only part of Harris' comments included in the brief video clip users shared on X.)\n\nMy plan as a candidate for president on the issue of drug prices is as follows: We are going to set drug prices based on fair market. So, essentially what we're going to do, and, you know, visit the website if you will, and if not, I can get you some documents. But, essentially what we're going to do is set drug prices so that American consumers are charged a price for drugs that is the average price that's being charged around the globe. [applause] And you're gonna… and there's a huge difference, insulin being an example.\n\nThe other thing is this. If people don't want to cooperate with that, I'm also going to do the next thing, which is this. A lot of drugs, prescription medication, was born out of federal funding for the research and development of that drug. Your taxpayer dollars. So, for any drug where they failed to play by our rules, and if that drug came about because of federal funding for what's called R&D, research and development, I will snatch their patent, so that we will take over. Yes, we can do that. Yes. Yes, we can do that. Yes, we can do that. The question is, do you have the will to do it? I have the will to do it.\n\nNearly five years after Harris made these remarks, The Associated Press reported on Aug. 15, 2024, that American taxpayers were expected to save billions of dollars after President Joe Biden's administration \"inked deals with pharmaceutical companies to knock down the lists prices for 10 of Medicare's costliest drugs .\" Those drugs include Januvia, Jardiance, Xarelto, Entresto and others. The reporting also added, \"But how much older Americans can expect to save when they fill a prescription at their local pharmacy remains unclear, since the list cost isn't the final price people pay.\"\n\nFurther, the Biden-Harris administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also lowered the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare."

      "article_title": "Claim That Kodak Hid Its Invention of Digital Camera Not So Simple",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nKodak engineer Steve Sasson invented the first portable, digital camera in 1975. Kodak received a patent for the device in 1978, but did not put it into production.\n\nWhile Kodak did not push forward with production in 1975 and challenged the wisdom of moving away from its camera-film market, the company's reasoning for not developing the digital camera was largely due to the device not being ready or practical for the market.\n\nIn December 2024, a popular series of posts on X asserted that \"a Kodak engineer invented the world's first digital camera,\" but was told by higher-ups to abandon the project, providing a \"painful lesson in business history\":\n\nThe post belongs to a long-standing genre of internet claims , holding that the film and camera company Eastman Kodak kept the digital invention hidden from the public because of the threat it posed to its photographic-film-based business model:\n\nAspects of this argument are true. Though larger-scale applications involving the digitization of images already existed, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created the first portable digital camera in 1975. He demonstrated the product to the company's executives, and they decided to patent the technology but not to develop it for sale.\n\nIt is an oversimplification to say that fear over a future film-less world led Kodak to \"hide\" the invention from the public, in part because it neglects the fact that the product was not ready at the time, that no real market for the product existed in 1975, and that Kodak further developed digital cameras following this initial invention. Kodak received substantial sums from the patent it received for Sasson's device in 1978, as well.\n\nIn 1973, at age 23, Sasson took a job as an electrical engineer at Kodak. As described by The New York Times in 2015, \"soon after arriving at Kodak, Mr. Sasson was given a seemingly unimportant task — to see whether there was any practical use for a charged coupled device (CCD), which had been invented a few years earlier.\" Such devices can translate light to digital signals, and are key to all digital cameras.\n\nTwo years later, he had finished his device — a Frankensteined mishmash of leftover lenses, circuits, and a cassette tape for memory. As described by the Times:\n\nThe final result was a Rube Goldberg device with a lens scavenged from a used Super-8 movie camera; a portable digital cassette recorder; 16 nickel cadmium batteries; an analog/digital converter; and several dozen circuits — all wired together on half a dozen circuit boards.\n\nBy 1976, Sasson was ready to demo the invention to executives at Kodak, as he described to the photography outlet PetaPixel:\n\n\"I would walk in with my crazy-looking camera, which was about the size of a toaster, but I could hold it,\" Sasson says. \"I took pictures of people in the room before I said anything. Then I took out the tape that the digital information was stored on and put it in the playback unit when a picture popped up on the TV screen. And that generally got everybody's attention.\"\n\n\"Indeed, they didn't ask me how this worked,\" Sasson says. They simply asked me why anybody would want to take a picture this way when there was nothing wrong with conventional photography. Nobody [including the bosses at Kodak] was asking me to develop this camera. In fact, nobody even knew that I was developing this camera.\n\nThe file size of the picture it produced — a black, white, and gray grid of 100 by 100 pixels — was 5 kilobytes. It took nearly a half a minute to save the data from the image to a cassette tape. \"It only took 50 milliseconds to capture the image, but it took 23 seconds to record it to the tape,\" Sasson said .\n\nWhen asked how long before this technology could match that of a film camera, Sasson figured it was about 15-20 years away. At the time, the photographs had to be displayed on a TV. Personal computers were far from ubiquitous — the first Apple I computer kit was released a year later in 1976.\n\nBusiness and marketing directors at Kodak were, indeed, skeptical of the wisdom of creating a product that could potentially make their photographic-film business obsolete. As reported in the Times, \"Kodak's marketing department was not interested in [Sasson's prototypes]. Mr. Sasson was told they could sell the camera, but wouldn't — because it would eat away at the company's film sales.\"\n\nWhile this may have been a motivating factor to some at Kodak, such concerns did not stop Kodak — or even Sasson — from further developing digital cameras and making several technical developments that led to Kodak's first publicly available digital camera in 1991, the Digital Camera System. As reported in a 1991 Associated Press article:\n\nEastman Kodak Co is taking its first step into filmless photography with an electronic camera system that can turn a conventional Nikon into a high-tech electronic camera. The Professional Digital Camera System will sell for about $20000. It is intended primarily for photojournalists and government surveillance, Kodak said.\n\nSasson's developments were crucial to develop this technology. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Sasson the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his contributions to digital photography.\n\nBecause the first portable digital camera was, indeed, invented in 1975 by Kodak, but because concerns about destroying its film business did not stop Kodak from developing the technology further, we rate this claim as a mixture of truth and falsehood."

They passed through a deep dark tunnel and emerged in sort of a twilight zone where there is an America without black people.\n\nAt first these white people breathed a sigh of relief. At last, they said, \"No more crime, drugs, violence and welfare. All of the blacks have gone!\"\n\nThen suddenly, reality set in. The \"NEW AMERICA\" is not America at all — only a barren land.\n\n1. There are very few crops that have flourished because the nation was built on a slave-supported system.\n\n2. There are no cities with tall skyscrapers because Alexander Mils, a black man, invented the elevator, and without it, one finds great difficulty reaching higher floors.\n\n3. There are few if any cars because Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gearshift, Joseph Gambol, also black, invented the Super Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines, and Garrett A. Morgan, a black man, invented the traffic signals.\n\n4. Furthermore, one could not use the rapid transit system because its procurer was the electric trolley, which was invented by another black man, Albert R. Robinson.\n\n5. Even if there were streets on which cars and a rapid transit system could operate, they were cluttered with paper because an African American, Charles Brooks, invented the street sweeper.\n\n6.

A. Love invented the Advanced Printing Press. They were all, you guessed it, Black.\n\n7. Even if Americans could write their letters, articles and books, they would not have been transported by mail because William Barry invented the Postmarking and Canceling Machine, William Purveys invented the Hand Stamp and Philip Downing invented the Letter Drop.\n\n8. The lawns were brown and wilted because Joseph Smith invented the Lawn Sprinkler and John Burr the Lawn Mower.\n\n9. When they entered their homes, they found them to be poorly ventilated and poorly heated. You see, Frederick Jones invented the Air Conditioner and Alice Parker the Heating Furnace. Their homes were also dim. But of course, Lewis Later invented the Electric Lamp, Michael Harvey invented the lantern and Granville T. Woods invented the Automatic Cut off Switch. Their homes were also filthy because Thomas W. Steward invented the Mop and Lloyd P. Ray the Dust Pan.\n\n10. Their children met them at the door-barefooted, shabby, motley and unkempt. But what could one expect? Jan E. Matzelinger invented the Shoe Lasting Machine, Walter Sammons invented the Comb, Sarah Boone invented the Ironing Board and George T. Samon invented the Clothes Dryer.\n\n11. Finally, they were resigned to at least have dinner amidst all of this turmoil. But here again, the food had spoiled because another Black Man, John Standard invented the refrigerator.\n\nNow, isn't that something? What would this country be like without the contributions of Blacks, as African-Americans?\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. said, \"by the time we leave for work, Americans have depended on the inventions from the minds of Blacks.\" Black history includes more than just slavery, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.\n\nPLEASE SHARE, ABUNDANTLY\n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1999]\n\nThis is a story of a little boy name Theo who woke up one morning and asked his mother, \"Mom, what if there were no Black people in the world?\"\n\nWell his mother thought about that for a moment, and then said \"Son, follow me around today and lets just see what it would be like if there were no Black people in the world.\"\n\nMom said, \"Now go get dressed and we will get started.\" Theo ran to his room to put on his clothes and shoes. His mother took one look at him and said \"Theo, where are your shoes, and those clothes are all wrinkled son, I must iron them.\"\n\nBut when she reached for the ironing board it was no longer there. You see Sarah Boone, a black woman, invented the ironing board and Jan E. Matzelinger, a black man, invented the shoe lasting machine.\n\n\"Oh well,\" she said, \"please go and do something to your hair.\" Theo ran in his room to comb his hair, but the comb was not there. You see, Walter Sammons, a black man, invented the comb. Theo decided to just brush his hair, but the brush was gone. You see Lydia O. Newman, a black female, invented the brush.\n\nWell this was a sight, no shoes, wrinkled clothes, hair a mess, even Moms hair, without the hair care inventions of Madam C.J. Walker, well you get the picture.\n\nMom told Theo, \"lets do our chores around the house and then take a trip to the grocery store.\" Theo's job was to sweep the floor. He swept and swept and swept. When he reached for the dust pan, it was not there. You see, Lloyd P. Ray, a black man, invented the dust pan. So he swept his pile of dirt over in the corner and left it there.\n\nHe then decided to mop the floor, but the mop was gone. You see, Thomas W. Stewart, a black man, invented the mop.\n\nTheo yelled to his Mom, \"Mom, I'm not having any luck.\" \"Well son,\" she said, \"let me finish washing these clothes and we will prepare a list for the grocery store.\" When the wash finished, she went to place the clothes in the dryer but it was not there. You see, George T. Samon, a black man, invented the clothes dryer.\n\nMom asked Theo to go get a pencil and some paper to prepare their list for the market. So Theo ran for the paper and pencil but noticed the pencil lead was broken. Well he was out of luck because John Love, a black man, invented the pencil sharpener.\n\nMom reached for a pen, but it was not there because William Purvis, a black man, invented the fountain pen. As a matter of fact, Lee Burridge invented the type writing machine, and W. A. Lovette the advanced printing press.\n\nTheo and his mother decided to head out to the market. Well when Theo opened the door he noticed the grass was as high as he was tall. You see, the lawn mower was invented by John Burr, a black man.\n\nThey made their way over to the car and found that it just wouldn't go. You see, Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gear shift and Joseph Gammel invented the supercharge system for internal combustion engines. They noticed that the few cars that were moving were running into each other and having wrecks because there were no traffic signals. You see, Garrett A. Morgan, a black man invented the traffic light.\n\nWell, it was getting late, so they walked to the market, got their groceries and returned home. Just when they were about to put away the milk, eggs and butter, they noticed the refrigerator was gone. You see John Standard, a black man, invented the refrigerator. So they just left the food on the counter.\n\nBy this time, Theo noticed he was getting mighty cold. Mom went to turn up the heat, and what do you know. Alice Parker, a black female, invented the heating furnace. Even in the summer time they would have been out of luck because Frederick Jones, a black man, invented the air conditioner. It was almost time for Theo's father to arrive home. He takes the bus. But there was no bus, because it's precursor was the electric trolley, invented by another black man, Elbert R. Robinson.\n\nHe usually takes the elevator from his office on the 20th floor, but there was no elevator because Alexander Miles, a black man, invented the elevator. He also usually dropped off the office mail at a near by mailbox, but it was no longer there because Philip Downing, a black man, invented the letter drop mailbox and William Barry invented the postmarking and canceling machine.\n\nTheo and his mother sat at the kitchen table with their heads in their hands. When the father arrived he asked, \"Why are you sitting in the dark?\" Why? Because Lewis Howard Latimer, a black man, invented the filament within the light bulb. Theo quickly learned what it would be like if there were no black people in the world. Not to mention if he were ever sick and needed blood. Charles Drew, a black scientist, found a way to preserve and store blood, which led to his starting the worlds first blood bank. And what if a family member had to have heart surgery? This would not have been possible without Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, a black doctor, who performed the first open heart surgery.\n\nSo if you ever wonder, like Theo, where would we be without black people? Well, it's pretty plain to see. We would still be in the DARK!!!!\n\nIF YOU GAINED ANY INSIGHT FROM THIS PLEASE PASS IT ON\n\nVariations: Another version also in circulation in 1999 presented the discussion thusly, instead of positioning it as an experience shared by Theo and his mother, as in the second example above:\n\nWell, God thought about that for a moment and then said, \"Son, follow me around today and let's just see what it would be like if there were no Black people in the world. Get dressed and we will get started.\"\n\nOrigins: We have been encountering this particular bit of online lore since 1997. Variously titled \"A World\n\nWithout Black People,\" \"Black Inventors and Inventions,\" \"America Without Black People,\" and \"Black History Facts,\" the piece has remained remarkably unchanged in that time. With the exception of its preface, the list that turns up in inboxes today is almost a carbon copy of that found in the earliest versions.\n\nThis summary of innovators and their creations is hard to classify as \"True\" or \"False\" for a number of reasons. First, it is flawed in its premise that if these African-American pioneers of manufacturing had not crafted the things they created, those items would never have been invented. Innovation does not wait upon particular inventors. If a sudden brainstorm is not experienced by one person, it will be visited upon another, as evidenced by the number of times in history where two or more people simultaneously conceived the same great idea and thereafter raced to patent and bring it to market first.\n\nSecond, the list is a mix of both accuracy and inaccuracy, even within single entries where fact and error cozy up against one another. While this compendium does outline a number of valid accomplishments, in many of the items the claims being advanced are overblown, crediting particular African-Americans with the invention of items for which they only crafted specific improvements. For example, Alexander Miles did not invent the elevator: that device was around long before he came on the scene, but he did devise an improved mechanism that governed the opening and closing of its doors, and he fashioned a key safety feature that automatically shut doors to the shaft when the car was on another floor, thereby keeping the muddle-headed from wandering into open shafts and thence their\n\ndeaths.\n\nThird, further clogging the assessment process is the realization that very few products can be said to have been the brainchild of just one person. Invention is largely the process of building on the technologies devised or improved by others, turning them to new purposes or using them in different ways. Therefore, many technologies don't really have definable start points — for instance, one would be hard pressed to name the inventor of the automobile. The automobile came into being through a process of gradual evolution rather arrived on the scene in completed form, in that as the components and design of self-propelled vehicles were reworked and refined, what would eventually become the automobile grew ever closer to being recognizable as the contraption we now know it as. There is no one definable moment in the automobile's history which one could without just fear of contradiction point to and say \"Here is where it began.\" In many instances, the people who get credit for \"inventing\" technologies are the ones who come up with the key steps that make them commercially viable or are the first to successfully market them, even though many, many other minds were involved in the process.\n\nGiven that there is no easy, short answer to the \"Is it true?\" question posed by those who receive this list and are left wondering about the claims made in the e-mailed summary of achievements, we'll have to go at it the long way.\n\nAlmost the opposite is true: with the exception of cotton and tobacco, which are labor-intensive crops throughout their growing processes and so require an ever-present workforce to raise, just about every major U.S. crop would have proved economically unfeasible under a slave-supported agrarian system. Crops such as wheat and corn require vast amounts of labor at the planting and harvesting stages, but precious little attention in between. Consequently, in pre-mechanized days, growers of just about anything that wasn't cotton or tobacco would have faced financial ruin if they'd opted to keep slaves rather than hire extra hands for those two short but widely-separated intensive bursts of activity. Slaves had to be fed, housed, clothed, and medicated year round; they would have represented a constant and substantial financial drain on farmers who tried to use them as their workforce.\n\nAs mentioned above, Alexander Miles (not Mils) did not invent the elevator. He devised certain improvements in elevator technology, and even those improvements had nothing to do with moving the cars up and down, which at least would have been a bit more in resonance with the \"invented the elevator\" claim. His contributions to elevator technology had to do with their doors.\n\nRichard Spikes crafted an improved automatic gear shift in 1932, but he did not invent this bit of technology.\n\nWe've so far been unable to locate any information about Joseph Gambol (or Gammel; we've seen it spelled both ways) or the \"Super Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines,\" and so at the moment we can't offer any insight into this entry.\n\nGarrett A. Morgan did invent the automated traffic signal in 1923, but the first known traffic signal was designed in 1868 by J.P. Knight in England. Morgan sold the rights to his patent to General Electric for $40,000, which was an astonishing sum back in those days.\n\nElbert (not Albert) R. Robinson invented an electric railway trolley in 1893. We're not sure, however, if his was the first invention of its kind.\n\nIn 1896 Charles Brooks devised improvements to street sweeper trucks, but not the vehicles themselves. His was a refinement of existing technology, not an invention of the technology itself.\n\nIn 1897 John Lee Love invented a simple, portable pencil sharpener he dubbed the \"Love Sharpener.\" Yet it was not the first implement of this nature: the manual pencil sharpener was invented in 1847 by Therry des Estwaux and was at least conceived of in 1828, the year a Frenchman named Bernard Lassimone applied for a patent on one.\n\nWilliam B. Purvis (not Purveys) patented a number of improvements to the fountain pen in 1890, but fountain pens themselves had been around since 1809.\n\nLee Burridge (not Barrage) fashioned a number of typewriter improvements, but he did not invent the typewriter — the first patent for such a machine was issued in 1868 to Christopher Latham Sholes .\n\nFinding information about W. A. Love has also so far proved difficult. However, he certainly didn't invent the printing press; the first of those was used in 1450 by Johannes Gutenberg .\n\nWilliam Barry invented a postmarking and canceling machine in 1897, but the first of that sort of contraption was created in England in 1857 by Pearson Hill.\n\nPhilip Downing did invent a particular kind of letter drop mailbox in 1891, but such boxes had been around at least since 1858.\n\nWilliam Purvis (not Purveys) did design a self-inking hand stamp in 1883, but the first postal handstamp is credited to Henry Bishop, Postmaster General of Great Britain, in the year 1661.\n\nJoseph Smith did indeed patent the swiveling lawn sprinkler in 1897; however, its companion in this entry does not fare as well. While it is true that in 1899 John Albert Burr did devise an improved rotary blade lawn mower, the patent for a \"machine for mowing lawns, etc.\" dates to 1830, to a British engineer named Edwin Beard Budding.\n\nFrederick McKinley Jones did not invent the air conditioner (that honor properly belongs to Willis Carrier, who patented it in 1902), but he did design the portable air conditioning unit used at military field hospitals in World War II. It allowed the military to store perishable life-saving medicines and blood serum close to the battlefield, even in the Pacific theater of operations where temperatures and humidity would otherwise have made short work of such products, and thus of the men dependent on receiving them.\n\nFurnaces have been around for thousands of years, dating back at least as far as to the Romans. While Alice Parker did in 1919 secure a patent on a furnace, hers was far from the first: by 1888, more than 4,000 patents on heating stoves and furnaces had been granted in the U.S.\n\nIn 1882 Lewis Howard Latimer (not Later) did indeed invent a method of making carbon filaments for the Maxim electric incandescent lamp, but he did not invent the lightbulb itself.\n\nMichael Harvey is another of those names we're having trouble locating information on, but we can safely say he didn't invent the lantern, as those devices had been around for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nGranville T. Woods did in 1889 invent an automatic safety cut-out for electric circuits, but we're not sure if his was the first of its kind.\n\nIn 1893 Thomas W. Stewart (not Steward) crafted a self-wringing form of mop, but did not invent the mop itself.\n\nIn 1897 Lloyd P. Ray invented not the dust pan, but the long-handled dust pan, a device that allowed the sweeper to not have to bend over to hold the pan to the floor so as to collect the sweepings.\n\nIn 1883 Jan Ernst Matzeliger (not Matzelinger) did indeed come up with an original innovation that changed how a particular item was made: he devised a machine that would sew the sole to the upper of a shoe in about a minute. His \"shoe lasting\" machine changed the process of how shoes were made by mechanizing a part of their manufacture that previously had to be done by hand and thereby cut the cost of making shoes by half.\n\nCombs have been around about as long as humans have; archaeologists are hard-pressed to find a burial mound or grave of any age that doesn't contain them. Walter Sammons invented a heated comb, a device to help with the straightening of hair.\n\nIn 1892 Sarah Boone invented an improvement to the ironing board, not the board itself. Her brainchild was a curved narrow board that allowed for the sleeves of ladies' garments to be stretched over it.\n\nGeorge T. Sampson (not Samon) was indeed granted the first U.S. patent for a clothes dryer, in 1892.\n\nIn 1891 John Standard came up with an improvement to the refrigerator, but not the refrigerator itself, which was first patented in Scotland in 1748 by William Cullen.\n\nIn researching all these items, we could not help but conclude that someone's zeal to praise black inventors instead potentially set up these innovators for ridicule. While only a small percentage of the general population has more than a smattering of knowledge about the histories of various products, that smattering is enough for the rest of us to realize that claims of a particular person's having invented the comb are ludicrous — a moment's thought about how long those implements have been around quickly reveals that assertion as farcical. (The same could be said of claims about the invention of the dust pan or the mop, although those assertions are slightly less obvious in their ludicrosity.) And with the \"You've got to be kidding\" dismissal of any one item comes the danger of a \"Yeah, right\" response to all the rest, the one bad item having poisoned perception of the others.\n\nThose who push past that set-back to do a little delving into some of the compendium's other trumpetings are quickly brought to the realization that this summary of African-American achievement time and again flat-out states that so-and-so \"invented\" a common item when history shows that person only crafted an improvement to a particular piece of technology, making his or her contribution on par with that of any number of non-African-American inventors that no one other than business scholars now has any awareness of. One who gets that far into the research process is likely to be left asking \"Is this the best that can be said of African-American inventors, that almost all of their contributions amounted to no more than small improvements to already existing technologies? Does the puffery inherent to this summary mean there was nothing substantial to celebrate, else the list would provide details of those in preference to making the wild overstatements it does?\"\n\nWhich brings us to the twin sadnesses of the matter: the list serves to obscure African-American contributions that should have been celebrated by shifting attention to items that were not nearly as vital, and makes black men and women who invented great things appear trivial by highlighting only their lesser innovations.\n\nFor example, you have Richard Spikes (of the improved automatic gear shift discussed above) to thank for your car's turn signals. He invented automatic directional lights, which were first installed on a Pierce Arrow automobile in 1913.\n\nIn 1935 Frederick McKinley Jones (of the portable air conditioning unit) invented the first refrigerated truck. He kept tinkering at his innovation, eventually developing a highly successful automatic refrigeration system for long-haul carriers. Prior to Jones' invention, many people were primarily limited to eating foods grown locally, because perishable goods could not be efficiently transported over longer distances.\n\nPercy Julian came up with a soy protein concoction that put out gas and oil fires not extinguishable by water. This material, known as \"bean soup\" aboard U.S. Navy ships, saved the lives of countless sailors during World War II. That same man, Percy Julian, came up with a way to synthesize cortisone, a sterol that has eased the sufferings of millions. Prior to his work, sterols cost several hundreds of dollars per gram; his process brought that cost down to 20 cents per gram.\n\nEven the relatively minor innovations to existing technologies for which the African-Americans listed above were responsible are important and vital in their own way, of course, but the \"LIFE WITHOUT BLACK PEOPLE\" piece misses its target due to too many inaccuracies and trivialities. There is much to laud in the roll call of black inventors, and someone should do them better service than the above-quoted article does.\n\nBarbara \"inventing my spleen\" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated: 24 May 2011\n\nSources:\n\nAaseng, Nathan.

She supplied bottles of the fluid to other secretaries at her workplace (under the name \"Mistake Out\") for several years; then, in 1956, she improved the formula, changed its name to \"Liquid Paper,\" and set out to trademark the name and patent her product.  After IBM passed on her offer to sell Liquid Paper to them, Bette started marketing the product on her own.  Liquid Paper, Inc., did not become profitable for several years, and it was not until the mid-1960s that Liquid Paper correction fluid began to generate substantial income for its inventor.\n\nLiquid Paper was sold to the Gillette Corporation in 1979 for $47.5 million (plus a royalty on every bottle sold until the year 2000).

      "article_title": "'Luciferase' Is Not an Ingredient in COVID-19 Vaccines",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn November 2021, Emerald Robinson, the White House correspondent for Newsmax, a conservative news network that has spread a number of conspiracy theories , posted a message on Twitter falsely claiming to her 400,000+ followers that one of the COVID-19 vaccines contains \"luciferase.\"\n\nThis is false. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine does not contain luciferase.\n\nWhat Is Luciferase?\n\nThis is not the first time that \"luciferase\" has been used to create fear over the COVID-19 vaccines. Back in April 2021, rumors circulated that the vaccines were called Luciferase , that they had been filed under an \"060606\" patent, and that this was evidence that the vaccines were connected in some form or other to Satan (or Lucifer).\n\nThis is all false .\n\nLuciferase is a genuine scientific term that refers to an enzyme capable of emitting light. If you've ever seen a firefly light up, you've witnessed luciferase in action. These enzymes are often used in research studies because they can help researchers monitor biological processes .\n\nLuciferases are enzymes that use a substrate called luciferin, along with oxygen and ATP, in an energetic process that produces light—like the yellow glow of fireflies. The power of luciferase has been harnessed by scientists to devise reactions whose light output is used to monitor biological processes including gene expression, biomolecular binding, and cell viability.\n\nIt's not exactly clear what Robinson meant when she tweeted that Luciferase was being used so \"you can be tracked.\" She seems to be implying that this bioluminescent marker will make vaccinated people glow, making them easier to track, but that's clearly not the case. Close to 200 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated and as far as we can tell nobody is glowing.\n\nIs Luciferase in COVID-19 Vaccines?\n\nRobinson's tweet (which has since been removed) linked to a video that supposedly showed \"evidence\" that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contains luciferase. In reality, this video highlighted one of the problems with the argument that people should \"do their own research.\"\n\nThe video starts with a Google search for \"does Moderna vaccine contain Luciferase?\" The top result for this search was an article published by Reuters in May 2021 entitled: \"Fact Check-Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine does not contain luciferin or luciferase.\"\n\nReuters wrote : \"The novel coronavirus vaccine manufactured by Moderna does not contain luciferin, an organic compound involved in bioluminescence, or the enzyme luciferase, contrary to claims on social media. While luciferase was involved in some COVID-19 research in the summer of 2020, none of the available vaccines contain either ingredient.\"\n\nThe video then shows this person \"doing their own research\" as they go to Moderna's website, click through a few pages, and open a PDF related to the company's vaccine patents. The researcher then performs a search for the word \"luciferase\" and finds a match. While this person presents this discovery as if it's evidence that luciferase is in the vaccine, this video shows no such thing. What this person found was that Moderna referenced a study about \"Luciferase\" while filing their patent, not that they included Luciferase in the vaccine. The study this person highlighted was published in 2012.\n\nAs noted earlier, luciferase was used during the development of the vaccine but it is not one of the ingredients in the vaccine. Here's a list of ingredients in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine :\n\n\"The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose.\""

Discussions about guns in America tend to be politically fraught, and so too is the terminology surrounding them.\n\nA frequent misconception about AR-15 firearms, for instance, is that the \"AR\" in the name stands for \"assault rifle.\" It does not. AR stands for ArmaLite Rifle, reflecting the company name ( ArmaLite ) of the original manufacturer of the weapon. Although ArmaLite sold the design of the rifle to Colt in 1959, the term \"AR-15\" has persisted and acts as a catch-all for similar guns, even though various models with different manufacturers have different names.\n\nArmaLite developed the weapon in the 1950s with the original intention that it would be used by the military but didn't have much success selling it before handing it off to Colt. As NPR reports , Colt had widespread success selling the automatic M-16 to the military, which troops used in Vietnam. Colt produced a semi-automatic, civilian version of that weapon and marketed it as the \"AR-15.\"\n\n\"When Colt's patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models,\" NPR reported. \"Those gun makers gave the weapons their own names, yet the popularity of the AR-15 turned it into a generic term for all types of AR-15-style rifles.\""

Thea Butler, 26, shared screenshots of the “feminine lip-stick” after seeing screenshots of the post and realizing Dopps worked only a few minutes from her mother’s house.\n\n“I thought it was satire at first, and then I started looking at it, and I was like, ‘no, this guy has got to be serious,’” Butler said over the phone.\n\nButler was one of many who responded with incredulity. Comments ranged from calling for Dopps to glue his mouth shut to asking whether he understood basic female anatomy.\n\nThe Mensez account shot back.\n\n“Yes, I am a man and you as a woman, should have come up with a better solution then diapers and plugs, but you didn’t,” read a comment from the now-unavailable Mensez Facebook account. “Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25% of the time, making them far less productive then they could be.”\n\nDopps' brothers answered questions about the Mensez controversy, distancing themselves and their businesses from their sibling's foray into inventing:\n\n“None of us agree with what he’s doing or trying to do,” Brad Dopps said over the phone. “We have tried to control his concept and marketing, and we have been unable to prevent his freedom of thought, expression and speech.”\n\nFred Dopps, another brother who owns a clinic at 2243 S. Meridian, said his brother’s idea has been “an embarrassment.”\n\n“Dan’s a great chiropractor, and he’s helped many people, but this has nothing to do with chiropractic, and I personally told him it was a bad idea to associate his name with the product,” Fred Dopps said over the phone. “I didn’t think it was in his best interest or the family name, which we’ve tried hard to build in this community.”\n\nAmong myriad news reports about Mensez were some that pointed out the product had not been fully developed, nor did it appear to exist even in prototype form. Much of the information about Mensez came from Dopps' since-deleted Facebook page, where he purportedly made a number of inflammatory comments about women, vaginas, and menstruation:\n\nAnyone with basic knowledge of human anatomy knows that the vagina is a muscular, tube-shaped structure, with its opening located behind the urethra, where the urine is expelled. Several women have suggested that Dopps is a misogynist, and that a man shouldn’t make products for women without firsthand knowledge of female anatomy.\n\nHe easily corroborated this charge in a response to one visitor's comment on the Mensez Facebook page, in which he explained that “[Y]ou as a woman should have come up with a better solution than diapers and plugs, but you didn’t. Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25% of the time, making them far less productive than they could be. Women tend to be far more creative than men, but their periods that [sic] stifle them and play with their heads.” Dopps added over the phone that “a lot of the LGBT community, lesbians in particular, are furious at me because I’m a white straight man.”\n\nAlthough it is true that Dopps was issued a patent for Mensez-like concept in January 2017, inventions do not have to work, or even be feasible concepts, in order to be patented .  It is possible that Mensez was the legitimate brainchild of a person not entirely familiar with female anatomy, but it is also within the realm of possibility the concept was nothing more than a media hoax.\n\nWe reached out to Dopps for general comment, and he sent us the following reply:\n\nQ: What made you come up with this?\n\nA: Innovation is essential it makes the world go round, we all have to have a new iPhone every year.   Feminine hygiene has not had any significant innovation in the past 50 years. That is if you don’t count a new colored boxes.\n\nI looked at the issues that women have like.  Security, comfort, reliability, cleanliness, convenience, humiliation, infections, health, discrete, cost, environment, and the overall hassle factor. I believe that Mensez is a simple elegant solution that will improve all of that, and that it will improve the lives of women around the world.\n\nQ: Can people actually order this [product], or is it still in the testing and funding stage?\n\nA: Mensez is not available. It an idea, with a patent a month ago, I am in the funding stage. Then there will need to be substantial development and testing and regulation approval.\n\nQ: What response are you getting from the women who have used it?\n\nNo one has used it. I do not have the final formulation or certification.  When that happens it will be done by licensed professionals.\n\nQ: Some might question your qualifications because you are a Chiropractor and not an OB/GYN ... How would you respond to those concerns?\n\nA: Those people believe that a person is not allowed to think outside of their little box or specialty. Yet they know that innovation comes from thinking outside the box ... I always ask, why and I do think outside of box.  I like to connect the dots between boxes.\n\nI do not practice obstetrics,  but in my Chiropractic degree I had classes in Obstetrics and Gynecology and I did passed my national board exams in them.  I do know the anatomy and physiology.\n\nQ: How long does an application of Mensez lipstick last?\n\nA: It will last until it comes in contact with urine, or soap and water.\n\nQ: How about when it comes to sex? Does it just dissolve or do you have to wash it off?\n\nA: Wash it off. I imagine that most women would freshen up any.  The same as if they were wearing a tampon.\n\nQ: How does it affect the delicate ecosystem of flora and PH balance of a woman’s vagina?\n\nA: I don’t see that there will be any negative affect on that, if anything it will only improve.\n\nThe PH is from natural secretions.\n\nThere is no air exchange with the blood, which can alter the PH, cause odors and promote bacterial growth\n\nThere are no potentially bacteria and chemical contaminated tampons being inserted.\n\nThe irritations from the absorbent materials is gone.  Irritations increases your risk of infection.\n\nMensez is an ELEGANT AND HEALTHY Idea\n\nThe PH in the vagina is 3.5-4.5, we are not changing that.   The PH of urine is 6.5-8, and the difference between the two PH’s is one thing that helps to dissolve the Mensez seal.  It’s natural.\n\nQ: Please take me back to the first clinical trials and how you were able to get women to try this, because messing around down there can be a little scary?\n\nA: There have not been any clinical trials.\n\nProbable 20 % of the emails that I have gotten are women volunteering to test it.\n\nI personally have no interest in doing that.\n\nQ: So Mensez Lipstick seals the lips shut when a woman is on her period… and the menstrual blood just collects in the vagina waiting to drain? Is that how it works?\n\nA: Yes, the menstrual blood collects in the vagina the same location that a tampon collects it.\n\nThe labia like all mucus membranes naturally want to stick together, it’s a very weak attraction and Mensez only increases that attraction between the labia.  It’s made of a combination of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and oil.  It is not a glue as so many have been calling it.  The seal that is created is strong enough to prevent leakage until it comes in contact with urine.  A woman will not feel sensation of stretching or hair pulling with her normal activity.\n\nQ: There might also be some concerns that a man designed this for women ... how have you battled those concerns?\n\nA: I have done very poorly, it’s tough to communicating, it is so taboo, and guys are not allowed to an opinion about periods\n\nQ: Would you let your wife or daughter use it?\n\nA: Absolutely!\n\nQ: Would you also recommend using a pad as well as Mensez Lipstick, or is there a need for a pad?\n\nA: Yes, I don’t believe that any women would want to take that risk, at least a panty liner is required initially until she learns to use it and develops confidence.   There are normal variations in anatomy, and there will be some women that it will not work for.  Each one them will have to experiment with it how it works for them.\n\nQ: What kind of response have you gotten?\n\nA: Website traffic ranges between has been scary. 10,000 and 75,000 visitors per day.\n\nThousands of emails and tweets from women wanting to buy it or volunteering to test it.\n\nA lot of high fives and companies and  foundations offering to provide funding, companies wanting distribution rights, Colombia, Bulgaria, Indonesia, South America.\n\nAnd there have been almost as many emails from haters, mainly because my Facebook post were not understood or taken out of context and there were some that were just wrong of me to post.\n\nI have had just set up the web site a month ago and started talking to women on face about Mensez.  There are a lot of smart women there that were willing to convers and share their issues.  I was not intending to offend anyone, I was totally unprepared and did not think that it would go viral.\n\nQ: And who is the ideal target age group for this?\n\nYounger women for sure, there are women that have bladder control issues and it will not work for them.  I do have some ideas for a similar solution that may come later for that group.  It will really come down to an individual bases and women will have to try it and see if they benefit.\n\nA: Did you ever consider pitching this on Shark Tank?\n\nWith all my patents I consider Shark tank, but not with this idea, it’s too early and will take a whole lot of funding.  Whoever does that will want all the rights.  I personally want to sell the idea and intellectual rights and go on doing what I do.\n\nWe note that both the questions and answers reproduced above came from Dobbs himself; he was not responding to a series of questions we posed to him ourselves."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared over the South China Sea on 8 March 2014 with 239 persons (227 passengers and 12 crew members) aboard. Several days later, a conspiracy theory was floated on the Internet that four of the passengers on that flight were all co-holders of a recently issued, highly valuable patent and the disappearance of Flight 370 was engineered to eliminate them so that remaining co-holder of the patent could reap all the royalties from it for himself:\n\nExample: [Collected via e-mail, March 2014]\n\nThis was posted on facebook in a discussion of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight: -------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere:\n\nFour days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office\n\n4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.\n\nPatent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders:\n\nPeidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%) Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%) Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%) Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%) Freescale Semiconductor (20%)\n\nIf a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.\n\nIf 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.\n\nThat remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.\n\nWho owns Freescale Semiconductor?\n\nJacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale.\n\nHere is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough. We have entered the future proper, and four men was just murdered so that the last, still living member can keep this for himself to either hide or profit from.\n\nThe improbabilities of such a theory are numerous. For starters, it's not clear the four men referenced as patent co-holders actually were on Flight 370, as their names (as rendered above) don't appear on the flight manifest . (It's possible that the seeming absence of some matching names from the manifest could be due to slight differences in the transliterations of those persons' names from Chinese to English, however.)\n\nMoreover, the patent in question is dated 11 March 2014 and involves a \"system for optimizing number of dies produced on a wafer.\" That doesn't sound like a highly valuable, \"breakthrough\" type of patent that would prompt the murder of four people (much less the death of 235 other innocent parties) in order to gain exclusive control of it. It looks to be a patent for a procedure that moderately improves the efficiency of a particular manufacturing process, not something with a huge market base and a vast potential for profit.\n\nAdditionally, the men listed are not actually the patent holders: they're the inventors/applicants, with the patent itself having been assigned to Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., of Austin, Texas. Presumably Freescale Semiconductor is their employer, and it's typical that engineers working in the employ of companies are required by the terms of their employment to assign ownership of their discoveries and inventions to their employers (and thus usually do not receive royalties from any resulting patents).\n\nIt's also not a given that if all but one of the co-holders of a patent dies, \"then the remaining one patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent\" as if a patent were some form of tontine to be awarded to the last man standing. Unless prior arrangements had been made in that regard, the share of the patent held by the deceased may pass to his heirs or estate through the usual inheritance process.\n\nFinally, although the Rothschild name may be a talisman for many conspiracy theorists, it isn't true that Jacob Rothschild \"owns\" Freescale Semiconductor. Freescale is a public company whose stock is held, in part, by 152 different institutional shareholders. The Blackstone Group, at which Jacob Rothschild serves as a member of the company's International Advisory Board, is one of the largest of those institutional holders (with over 196 million shares), but the Carlyle Group and TPG Group Holdings both own a number of Freescale shares equal to that held by Blackstone."

      "article_title": "Here's the Patent Michael Jackson Filed for 'Anti-Gravity Illusion Shoes'",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe late Michael Jackson was known for his choreographic ability to seemingly defy gravity — a skill often attributed to the music legend's astronomical footwear.\n\nA part of the King of Pop's legacy holds that the musician once filed a patent for \"anti-gravity illusion shoes\" that were used in the music video for his song \"Smooth Criminal.\" It's a claim reported by publications such as The Atlantic , NPR and Time and shared on social media platforms including Reddit ( archived ), Instagram ( archived ) and TikTok ( archived ).\n\nOn June 6, 1992, Triumph International filed patent number US5255452A (also available here and here ) under the names Michael J. Jackson, Michael L. Bush and Dennis Tompkins. Titled \"Method and means for creating anti-gravity illusion,\" the patent abstract read:\n\nA system for allowing a shoe wearer to lean forwardly beyond his center of gravity by virtue of wearing a specially designed pair of shoes which will engage with a hitch member movably projectable through a stage surface. The shoes have a specially designed heel slot which can be detachably engaged with the hitch member by simply sliding the shoe wearer's foot forward, thereby engaging with the hitch member.\n\nThe \"anti-gravity illusion effects\" were for \"entertainment purposes\" only, and the patent described a specialized footwear that essentially allowed its wearer to clip into various points on a specially equipped stage. In essence, the shoes served as an anchor and allowed their wearer to lean forward \"at a very acute angle relative to the stage floor to achieve the illusion of defying gravity.\"\n\nThe patent filers went on to describe previous mechanisms for how Jackson previously achieved his on-stage anti-gravity effect in recorded performances. This effect was \"accomplished by the use of cables connecting a harness around the dancer's waist with hooks on a stage, thereby allowing the dancer to lean forward at the required degree.\"\n\nThese techniques required stagehands to connect and disconnect cables, rendering the system unusable during live performances.\n\nIncluded in the patent were drawings of the invention showing different perspectives of the shoes with the fastening straps open and closed (figures 1, 2 and 3) and another as if the user was wearing socks to cover the straps (figures 4 and 5).\n\nAdditional drawings show the shoes in use, including a side perspective of a dancer wearing the shoes and \"leaning forward beyond his center of gravity (Figure 6) and \"optimum spacing of the pair of hitches relative to the shoulders of the performing artist (Figure 14).\n\n(Google Patents)\n\nThe bottom perspective of the heel of the shoe is also shown in great detail (below left) as is the \"hitch carrying plate\" and \"stage engagement mechanism\" to which it is secured (below right).\n\n(Google Patents)\n\nThe National Archives Store sells a \" Michael Jackson's Anti-Gravity Patent Magnet Set \" online.\n\nJackson has been at the center of many Snopes fact checks, including whether the singer owned the rights to all the Beatles songs and whether he was the biological father of Bruno Mars ."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nMicrosoft published a patent for a \"cryptocurrency system using body activity data.\" This patent is filed under the number WO2020060606A1.\n\nThe number WO2020060606A1 contains three \"6's\" but is obviously not the same as \"666.\" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips.\n\nSnopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated , how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes.\n\nThis conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain.\n\nThis patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers \"666,\" the biblical \"mark of the beast,\" and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the \"World Order.\"\n\nThe above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, \"WO\" does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil's number.\n\nThis patent is for a \"cryptocurrency system\" that \"uses body activity data.\" Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number \" WO2020060606A1 .\"\n\nThe patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips.\n\nThe diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the \"person,\" \"user device,\" and \"sensor\" are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the \"user device\" in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets:\n\nUser device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6.\n\nThe patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The \"sensor\" may also be its own standalone component:\n\nSensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130.\n\nAt no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person's skin.\n\nSo what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number \" WO2020060606A1.\" It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However \"patent WO2020060606A1\" is not the same as \"patent 666.\"\n\nFurthermore, the \"WO\" at the start of this patent does not stand for \"World Order.\" It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The \"A1\" at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The \" kind code \" B1 is applied to granted patents.\n\nWe reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back.\n\nTo sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number \"WO2020060606A1\" contains three \"6's,\" this appears to be little more than a coincidence."

This includes people both living and dead.\n\nThere are no plans to develop this technology at Microsoft as of this writing.\n\nReal-life technology may be more like an episode of the Netflix show \"Black Mirror\" than we realize. A chatbot that could be developed by Microsoft is remarkably similar to technology seen in an episode of the science fiction show that allowed a character to talk to an artificial version of her deceased partner.\n\nIn December 2020, Microsoft was granted a patent for a chatbot that allows users to have a virtual conversation with any specific person, living or dead. According to the filing from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this could be a \"past or present entity ... such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure.”\n\nHowever, in a tweet posted in January 2021, Tim O’Brien, Microsoft's general manager of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs, said, “there’s no plan for this. But if I ever get a job writing for Black Mirror, I’ll know to go to the USPTO website for story ideas.” (The \"Black Mirror\" episode in question, \" Be Right Back ,\" aired in 2013 , years before Microsoft applied for the patent.) He said in a separate tweet that Microsoft applied for this patent in April 2017, which “predates the AI ethics reviews we do today (I sit on the panel), and I'm not aware of any plan to build/ship (and yes, it's disturbing).”\n\nAccording to the patent filing , social data would be accessed using “images, voice data, electronic messages, social media posts, written letters” to modify a “special index in the theme of the specific person’s personality. The special index may be used to train a chat bot to converse and interact in the personality of the specific person.”\n\nWhile this chatbot may not be in development, the patent was indeed granted to Microsoft on Dec. 1, 2020 . We thus rate this claim as “Mostly True.”"

      "article_title": "Why Do Milk Jugs Have Circle Indentations?",
      "text": "The existence of circle indents on plastic milk containers is a recurring source of internet speculation. \"Why do milk jugs have these,\" a Redditor asked in a 2015 post in the r/whatisthis, for example. The thread was marked resolved after the group settled, incorrectly, on three explanations.\n\nIn July 2021, as another example, USA Today covered a viral Facebook claim about those circular indentations. Both the Reddit thread and the Facebook post included the same claim: that these indentations \"pop\" out, thanks to gas buildup produced as milk spoils. This claim is false. Instead, these indentations represent efforts by the dairy industry to lower packaging costs while making their product visually appealing.\n\nAs stated on patent documents for a plastic milk jug containing circle indents, two reasons for them exist: \"to control [the] fill level of a given volume of contents\" and \"to further stabiliz[e] the sidewalls\" of a container. This article explores why the expiration explanation fails, and how we know these other two explanations — like a plastic container — hold water.\n\nIndentations Cannot Be Related to Milk Expiration\n\nThe assertion that plastic milk container indents \"pop\" when milk expires relies on the flawed assumption that the process of milk spoilage produces gas. While gas production can occur in some situations, this is not a valid assumption in most cases. That's because the pasteurization process typically kills the forms of bacteria that produce gas, and because most milk spoilage processes do not produce gas as a byproduct.\n\nIn their debunking of the milk expiration claim, USA Today interviewed Bob Roberts, a professor and the head of food science at Pennsylvania State University:\n\nAccording to Bob Roberts … there are two types of bacteria in milk: those that survive the pasteurization process and those that are introduced afterward. While it's possible that gas producers are among those bacteria, it's not always the case, he said.\n\nWhen milk is refrigerated, it generally spoils because bacteria that survived the pasteurization process break down fats and proteins, creating the sour smell that tells you your milk has gone bad. The bacteria responsible for this generally don't produce gas, so the circle would remain indented even though the milk is old.\n\nAs an indicator of spoilage and an explanation for the indentations, then, a gas-based mechanism would be an abject failure.\n\nIndentations Provide Structural Support While Lowering Production Costs\n\nPlastic milk containers are created by blowing plastic resin into a mold. Thanks to the scale of milk jug production, even miniscule reductions in the amount of resin per container could result in large savings. As that milk jug patent explains , the problem is that it becomes difficult structurally to \"provide a container which will remain stable and retain an attractive appearance once filled.\"\n\nThe circle indentations, in part, increase the structural viability of the container and reduce the appearance of a bulge. Their purpose, as described in that patent document, includes \"further stabilizing the sidewalls\" of the container, which can allow for a reduction in the thickness of the container walls and therefore reduce the amount of material used in their production.\n\nIndentations Allow For a Consistent Fill Level\n\nMilk containers must contain precisely measured servings of milk. More important than that, in terms of actually selling the product, is making sure they each appear full to the brim, too. Thanks to seasonal changes and other factors that potentially shrink them , adjustments to the volume of a milk container are occasionally needed. As USA Today explained , \"interchangeable volume inserts – which are the indentations you see – allow them to do that without changing the base molds\" used in the production of the containers.\n\nThe patent filing lays this out as well: \"the size and depth of the indentations may be varied … and are used to control the fill level of the container.\" This quick flexibility is significant, USA Today explained , \"because if jugs shrink too much, milk could overflow, but if jugs are too large, they will appear underfilled, even though the amount of milk is the same.\" Citing an interview with an executive at a plastic container production company, USA Today wrote that \"customers won't buy\" bottles that appear underfilled.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCircle indents on milk containers are there for structural support and allow for changes to the volume of a plastic container. The former is done to reduce the material used while maintaining structural support, the latter is done to maintain the appearance of a full bottle in the face of various factors that potentially modify a container's volume. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to pop when expired, though."

      "article_title": "Were These Actual Mistakes in the 1997 'Titanic' Film?",
      "text": "The 1997 movie \"Titanic\" was widely beloved for its epic romance that made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, and for the special effects that director James Cameron used in depicting the sinking ship.\n\nThe real Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in April 1912 , during its maiden voyage from England, across the Atlantic, to New York City. For decades since the movie’s release, eagle-eyed fans have debated the historical accuracies (and inaccuracies) in the film, coming up with their own analyses , and breaking down each scene.\n\nWe have compiled a few popular fan criticisms from Screenrant and BestLifeOnline of the so-called inaccuracies below, and assessed whether such critiques are actually warranted.\n\nThis claim from Best Life Online is incorrect. Flashlights were available from the 1890s . American Ever-Ready Company’s Conrad Hubert began acquiring the first Eveready flashlight patent in 1898. The actual inventor behind the flashlight was David Misell , who at first intended it to be a bike lamp. The first Eveready flashlight with on-off switches was released in 1911, the year before the Titanic sank.\n\nA diagram of the first portable flashlight is available in the patent document, and it was finalized in 1899.\n\nBelow is an advertisement for the flashlight from 1899, found on Wikimedia Commons:\n\nThis is the clip from \"Titanic\" with the flashlights:\n\nIn the movie, the crew investigating the sinking of Titanic uncovers an old sketch of Rose — the main character, played by Winslet — that had gone down with the ship in 1912. The aging Rose spots the sketch of herself on television and calls them, kicking off her telling of the story about what she experienced on that fateful journey.\n\nThe above claim from Best Life Online is incorrect. First, the main character played by DiCaprio is named Jack, not \"Will.\" In the below clip, taken from the 1997 movie, the date written on the sketch is April 14, 1912. The Titanic hit the iceberg on that very date.\n\nIn the movie, Jack smokes a cigarette on the deck as Rose runs past him, right before she considers jumping off the ship. Many viewers said he was smoking a mass-produced filter cigarette — something that didn't exist in 1912. But without evidence that DiCaprio was actually smoking a filter cigarette, and just smoking a regular cigarette that was available at the time, we've concluded that this claim is unproven.\n\nIn 1925 , a man named Boris Aivaz in the U.K. began experimenting with filters and applied for a patent to use crepe paper and cellulose to produce cigarette filter tips. They came into wider use in the 1930s. Mass-produced filter cigarettes were produced in the 1950s by a chemist named Claude Teague, who developed a filter that turned “from white to brown, providing, he felt, comfort to smokers who assumed they were seeing dangerous particles kept from their lungs.” The 1950s and 60s saw tobacco companies shifting to designing and researching filtered cigarettes in an attempt to claim these mitigated the health hazards of smoking.\n\nBut was Jack actually smoking a filtered cigarette in that scene? It is difficult to tell if the cigarette in question has a filter. We found clips of Jack smoking throughout the movie:\n\nIn the scene where he is lying on the bench, it does indeed look like there is a filter in the cigarette, though it is difficult to confirm. However, the cigarettes he smoked in the movie still looked like cigarettes being smoked at the time.\n\nBelow are some advertisements from 1910-1912 that feature standard cigarettes, much like the ones being smoked in the film:\n\nIn the below clips it is difficult to discern the exact details of the $20 notes that Cal sticks in Officer Murdoch’s pockets, and that Murdoch subsequently throws back in Cal's face in another scene. This claim is only partly untrue because while the bills used aren't exact replicas of the 1914 notes, they are also likely historically inaccurate for the time.\n\nThe fake notes in the movie, however, were not exact replicas of the real Federal Reserve notes that were printed in 1914 with former President Grover Cleveland’s face printed on them. The border around the “20” is different.\n\nOn the left is the bill issued in 1914, on the right one issued in 1929:\n\nIt is correct that the Federal Reserve notes became the dominant paper money in 1914, replacing national bank notes. But the film did not use that exact note, though they used fake money that looked close enough. Insider found all the $20 notes in U.S. history and compiled a list of what they looked like. In 1912, the real notes would have likely been very different from what Cal used in the movie.\n\nCameron’s version of First Officer Murdoch actually generated some controversy. In the film (clips featured above), Murdoch is seen accepting a bribe from Cal, throwing the money back in his face soon after, shooting a man in an attempt to control the crowd, and then shooting himself with remorse.\n\nThe above claim is true. In reality, Murdoch was considered a hero in his Scottish hometown. Historians described him as having done his best to save passengers, even throwing deck chairs overboard for those in the water to cling to. Scott Neeson, vice president of 20th Century Fox, actually traveled to Murdoch’s town of Dalbeattie to apologize to his then-80-year-old nephew for the way the film portrayed Murdoch. Neeson also wrote a letter to the town’s member of Parliament, acknowledging that they had no evidence that Murdoch had acted the way he was depicted in the movie.\n\n\"As a Scotsman myself and one who has spent some of the best days of my life in the heart of Dalbeattie, no one is more interested in putting the record straight about one of its citizens than I am,\" Neeson wrote .\n\nThere are countless other posts “debunking” mistakes, some of which are correct, and others that add more errors to the narrative surrounding the movie 'Titanic.' We will keep adding to this list over time."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nSnopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nIn mid-2020, the American biotechnology company Moderna received prominent news coverage about their efforts to develop a vaccine to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\n\nAt that time, internet users were circulating a bit of text tying Moderna to infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hungarian-born financier George Soros, and American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, figures who previously had all been the subjects of various baseless conspiracy theories.\n\nThe text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it:\n\nThe vaccine that is coming...\n\nAs many of you heard Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing.\n\nIf all goes well it'll become federal law to get the vaccine.\n\nHere's something many of you don't know,\n\nguess who the first CEO of Moderna was?\n\nA Cornell graduate by the name of Anthony Fauci, who was a roommate with none other than Bill Gates.\n\nAre you paying attention?\n\nIt was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852.\n\nAre you awake yet?\n\nNow let's really go down the rabbit hole.\n\nModerna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben.\n\nIG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust.\n\nAfter Germany fell, IG Farben was dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros.\n\nSoros rebranded the company as Moderna.\n\nAnd who was the primary stockholder of Moderna until his death?\n\nJeffrey Epstein.\n\nHis role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections.\n\nLet that sink in. Wake up people! You are being conditioned and controlled.\n\nFor the \"Is this true?\" record, we note the following:\n\n1) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has never been the CEO of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna. Fauci has been the director of NIAID since 1984, while ModeRNA Therapeutics was not founded until 2010. Fauci also graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1966 and therefore could not possibly have been college roommates with technology mogul Bill Gates, who attended Harvard College for a few years in the mid-1970s.\n\n2) Bill Gates, who did not attend Cornell, also did not design or patent radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. The first such patent was taken out in 1973 by Mario Cardullo , and the patent number provided in the message text ( US2006257852 ) actually points to a patent related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus rather than any RFID technology.\n\n3) Notorious chemical and pharmaceutical company IG Farben was not \"dissolved\" after World War II by George Soros, who was not a Nazi (or a German) and was only 14 years old when Germany surrendered in 1945. The victorious Allied powers seized IG Farben's surviving assets and split the firm up into smaller constituent companies.\n\n4) Financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offenses in 2008 and committed suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, got his start in the world of finance as a trader at Bear Stearns in 1976 and later founded his own money-management consulting firm, Financial Trust Company.\n\nExactly how much money Epstein had and how he acquired his wealth remain subjects of some mystery , but he was not the \" primary stockholder \" of Moderna, and he was already worth a reputed nine figures well before the 2010 founding of that company."

      "article_title": "Monopoly Board Game's 'Anti-Capitalist' Origins",
      "text": "In a set of Monopoly rules published by Hasbro ( archived ), the company that distributes the popular board game, the story of the game's invention goes like this:\n\nIn 1934, Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, Pennsylvania, presented a game called MONOPOLY to the executives of Parker Brothers. Mr. Darrow, like many other Americans, was unemployed at the time and often played this game to amuse himself and pass the time. It was the game's exciting promise of fame and fortune that initially prompted Darrow to produce this game on his own. With help from a friend who was a printer, Darrow sold 5,000 sets of the MONOPOLY game to a Philadelphia department store. As the demand for the game grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game.\n\nBut the legend Hasbro tells about Monopoly overlooks a few important details — including the contributions of Elizabeth Magie, the woman who invented the first version of Monopoly, which she called The Landlord's Game.\n\nSocial media users sought to correct the record on X ( archived ) and Facebook ( archived ):\n\nMuch of the information shared in these posts is accurate. Patents issued in 1904 and 1924 credit a game-board design to \"Lizzie J. Magie\" and \"Elizabeth Magie Phillips,\" years before the 1934 tale from Hasbro begins. The patents share many similarities to modern Monopoly, including rules about paying rent and earning wages each time a player moves around the board. While the \"two sets of rules\" referenced in social media posts have been reported by numerous reputable news outlets, including The Washington Post , Snopes was unable to independently verify their existence.\n\nAn image of \"The Landlord's Game\" from Magie's 1904 patent (left) and from her 1924 patent (right).  (U.S. Patent Office )\n\nMagie's 1904 and 1924 patents do not include two sets of rules. There are some references online to a version of Magie's game published in 1932 that allegedly included the \"Prosperity\" rules, but we weren't able to independently verify this. According to a website run by Thomas Forsyth, reportedly a private collector of Landlord's Game material, the 1932 game was published under Magie's 1924 patent by The Adgame Company with the two sets of rules.\n\nForsyth did not return a request for comment from Snopes, as of this writing, but we're including this because Forsyth's website was referenced by reputable experts such as journalist Mary Pilon, who wrote \"The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury and the Scandal Behind the World's Favorite Board Game.\" Snopes will update this story if we hear back from Forsyth.\n\nAccording to Pilon, much of Magie's story came to light through court documents and depositions from a case known as Anti-Monopoly, Inc. vs. General Mills Fun Group, Inc., which began after the Parker Brothers sued an economics professor, Ralph Anspach, over a game he made called \"Anti-Monopoly.\"\n\nPer \"The Monopolists,\" that court case included a deposition from a friend of Darrow, Charles Todd. Snopes could not independently verify the deposition; Pilon told Snopes the book took five years of research and involved scouring \"libraries, census records and other sources\" to vet the information in it. (Pilon also provided Snopes with a free review copy of her book.)\n\nTodd described teaching a modified version of Magie's game to Darrow, who later asked for a written set of rules and eventually sold the game to the Parker Brothers, which is where Hasbro's version of the story comes from.\n\nIn 1936, Magie spoke to The Washington Post and The Evening Star about creating the game before Darrow sold it to Parker Brothers. The Evening Star reported she sold her patent rights to Parker Brothers in November 1935 for $500 and no royalties.\n\nMagie's 1904 patent also clearly stated the intention of her game long before Darrow came along:\n\nThe object of the game is to obtain as much wealth or money as possible, the player having the greatest amount of wealth at the end of the game after a certain predetermined number of circuits of the board have been made being the winner.\n\nWas 'The Landlord's Game' a Critique of Capitalism?\n\nSome social media posts note that Magie's game originally critiqued income inequality, like this one on X ( archived ):\n\nHasbro, who owns the rights to Monopoly, has gone to great lengths to conceal that it was invented in 1903 by a leftist Georgist named Elizabeth Magie, out of her frustration with the grotesque income inequality of her time. Magie originally called it \"The Landlord Game.\" https://t.co/QSF1xTW2Nb\n\n— Lee Hepner (@LeeHepner) April 11, 2024\n\nOther online users called Magie's game \"anti-capitalist\" or a \"critique of capitalism,\" such as this post on X ( archived ):\n\nthis man single-handedly inciting a class war through messaging like this is fascinating. monopoly is intended to be an anti-capitalist game demonstrating the negative impacts of economic privilege & private monopolies. https://t.co/t9vpHVuwbW\n\n— kemi marie (@kemimarie) December 8, 2024\n\nIt's true Magie had progressive ideals. She was a Georgist, according to Pilon's book, which meant she believed in the economic theories of Henry George , a proponent of the \"single tax\" or \"land value tax.\" George believed individuals should own everything they made or created, but land should belong to everyone — and as such, if people wanted to own land, that land should be taxed. All other goods were meant to remain untaxed.\n\nMagie also explains her rationale for creating the game in her 1924 patent (emphasis is ours):\n\nThe object of the game is not only to afford amusement to the players, but to illustrate to them how under the present or prevailing system of land tenure, the landlord has an advantage over other enterprises and also how the single tax would discourage land speculation.\n\nHer 1904 patent includes an illustration of her game board with \"LABOR UPON MOTHER EARTH PRODUCES WAGES\" written on it, a reference to George's views, according to \"The Monopolists.\"\n\nWhether Magie's board game can accurately be called \"anti-capitalist\" depends on your interpretation of George's views.\n\nFor example, in his book \"Henry George and the Crisis of Inequality,\" history professor Edward T. O'Donnell called George's views a critique of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, an economic theory opposing government intervention in the market. But a philosophy professor at Auburn University, Robert V. Andelson, said in a 2004 address that George's views incorporated tenets of both capitalism and socialism:\n\nGeorge considered himself a purifier of Capitalism, not its enemy. He built upon the foundations laid by the classical economists. The skeleton of his system was essentially Capitalist. In fact, Karl Marx referred to George's teaching as \"Capitalism's last ditch.\"\n\nThus, it's true that Magie existed and the story Hasbro and the Parker Brothers tell about Monopoly's origins is missing her contributions — but some of the details described online about the popular board game's history are difficult to verify or are more nuanced than they appear."

According to a photograph commonly shared on Reddit and other social media platforms, the ingredients were alcohol, cannabis, chloroform, and \"morphia, sulph\" — a dated name for morphine.\n\nOne Night Cough Syrup, manufactured by Kohler Manufacturing Co., was indeed a real product. Newspaper ads and pamphlets from the late 1800s and early 1900s are littered with ads for the product, which claimed to stop \"that tickling in the throat … almost instantly.\"\n\nKohler was a big player in the so-called patent medicine market. Companies involved in this business claimed to produce proprietary concoctions able to cure a wide range of ailments.\n\nEntirely unregulated, such drugs' effects, if any, could often be attributed to what would now be considered hardcore narcotics, recreational drugs, or some combination of the two. A series of exposes in the early 1900s and the passage of new laws led to increased scrutiny of the patent medicine market.\n\nIn 1910, Kohler's One Night Cough Syrup was specifically referenced on a list of \"habit-forming agents\" published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That document confirms the product's ingredients match the label in the viral image:\n\nTo a modern audience, such a concoction's over-the-counter use sounds absurd. We note, however, that the product was maligned as being irresponsible over a century ago, as well.\n\nAn imagined conversation between a woman, a pharmacist, and a doctor, published in a 1914 newspaper article, also uses One Night Cough Syrup as an example of the dangers of not reading the label on patent medicine:\n\n\"We think ourselves heirs to the wisdom of the ages, without stopping to consider that we're heirs to the foolishness, also.

That's harmless, isn't it?\" The druggist glanced at Dr. Strong, and they both grinned.\n\n\"It might be harmless,\" said the druggist mildly, \"if it didn't contain both morphine and hasheesh.\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" said Mrs. Clyde, hor- rifled. \"How could one suppose-\"\n\n\"By reading the label carefully,\" interjected Dr. Strong.\n\nBecause contemporaneous records attest to both the existence of this product and the specific ingredients included, we rate the claim as \"True.\""

      "article_title": "Musk Was Once an Undocumented Immigrant in US?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nA viral meme in the mid-2010s claimed that South African-born Elon Musk — one of the most influential tech entrepreneurs of our time as the founder of SpaceX and CEO of Tesla — was once, in his brother's words, an \"illegal immigrant\" in the United States.\n\nThis isn't the first time Snopes has attempted to fact-check this claim. In 2016 , we explored whether Musk's immigration status had ever been \"illegal,\" pointing out that his pathway from student visa to U.S. citizenship in 2002 appeared to involve various legal visa programs and categories.\n\nThe claim gained traction again on social media platforms like Reddit and Facebook after an old interview resurfaced in 2024, in which Musk's younger brother, restaurateur Kimbal Musk, mentioned their uncertain immigration status while recounting the early days of their tech startup, Zip2 .\n\nFor instance, on March 8, 2024, an Instagram account shared the following clip from that 2013 interview with the Musk brothers, where they discussed their prior U.S. immigration statuses:\n\nA post shared by Joe Fionda (@fiondavision)\n\nSo, was Elon Musk ever truly an undocumented immigrant in the U.S., or does this story have more nuance? Snopes reexamined the claim about Musk being a former undocumented immigrant, searching for any new developments in the eight years since we first explored the claim about his U.S. legal status. Musk's Murky Immigration Timeline N ew discussions around Musk's immigration journey were likely prompted by the recirculation of that interview in early 2024, perhaps due to his comments surrounding unchecked migration to the U.S. For example, in February 2024, Musk tweeted the following message, which had received nearly 33 million views as of this writing: (Elon Musk/X) However, on Sept. 29, 2024, Musk followed up with another post that many interpreted as anti-migrant, in which he claimed, \"T he Biden/Harris administration has been flying 'asylum seekers', who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona. It is a surefire way to win every election. \" That post had more than 103 million views as of this writing. (Snopes investigated a set of claims very similar to this in March 2024.) A new report by The Washington Post , published Oct. 26, 2024, attempted to uncover the truth about Musk's own pathway to U.S. immigration, concluding that he \" worked illegally in the United States as he launched his entrepreneurial career after ditching a graduate studies program in California. \" For its report, The Washington Post spoke with several of Musk's former business associates in Silicon Valley from the 1990s and with immigration experts. The report did not clarify whether those immigration experts had any direct working knowledge of Musk's immigration case. It's also worth noting that under the Privacy Act of 1974 , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services does not share or discuss personal immigration information about U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents due to privacy considerations. Much of what we know about Musk's pathway to citizenship comes directly from his statements to the media. Although we reached out to Musk for clarification, he had not responded as of this writing. Derek Proudian, a board member for the Musks' former internet startup Zip2, which they founded in late 1995, told the Post, \"Their immigration status was not what it should be for them to be legally employed running a company in the U.S.,\" adding, \"We don't want our founder being deported.\" The Post also referenced an unnamed 2020 podcast, in which Musk reportedly said he had a \" student-work visa \" in 1995 after deferring his studies. Musk stated in the podcast, \" I was legally there, but I was meant to be doing student work, \" adding to The Post, \" I was allowed to do work sort of supporting whatever. \" The outlet unearthed several documents, including an email Musk apparently wrote in 2005 to Tesla co-founders Martin Eberhard and JB Straubel. Reportedly submitted as evidence in a defamation lawsuit between Musk and Eberhard, the email included Musk's account of his decision to defer Stanford to launch his internet startup, but it did not confirm Musk's past immigration status. Per the Post's recounting of the email: \"I didn't really care much for the [Stanford] degree, but I had no money for a lab and no legal right to stay in the country, so that seemed like a good way to solve both issues,\" Musk wrote. \"Then the internet came along, which seemed like a much surer bet.\" The day after the Post published its report on Musk's apparent past illegal status in the U.S. on Oct. 26, 2024, he responded on X, asserting that he did have a J-1 nonimmigrant visa , which later transitioned to an H-1B visa, allowing him to to participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S.: I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B. They know this, as they have all my records. Losing the election is making them desperate. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2024 The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website describes a J-1 classification as authorized for individuals participating in approved programs for teaching, researching, lecturing, studying, observing or consulting . Musk obtained Canadian citizenship several years prior to enrolling at Stanford University in 1995. Canadians generally do not need a U.S. entry visa if they have an F-1 student visa or J-1 visa . However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does require Canadian students to obtain an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility from their chosen U.S. institution or exchange program. The Origin of the 'Illegal' Claim This claim that Musk once had \"illegal\" status in the U.S. seemed to stem from the 2013 interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference . During the interview, Kimbal Musk recalled that venture capitalists they met in 1996 (before Elon graduated from the University of Pennsylvania) \" realized that we were illegal immigrants. \" Elon Musk laughed and corrected him, saying it was more of a \"gray area.\" This potentially tongue-in-cheek response fed the narrative that Musk lived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant between 1995 and 1997, prior to becoming a U.S. citizen in 2002. A closer look at the timeline paints a more complicated picture. Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk moved to Canada in 1989 after securing Canadian citizenship through his mother, model and dietitian Maye Musk, who was born in Regina, Canada. Musk's move marked his first step toward legal immigration to North America. In 1992, Musk transferred from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Philadelphia. While reports indicate that Musk enrolled in UPenn on a student visa, they don't specify the visa type. Immigration consultancy Papaya Global claimed he arrived in the U.S. on an F-1 foreign student visa, but this detail remains unconfirmed. Musk's documented legal authorization to reside in the U.S. seems to have begun with this initial student visa. Although Musk did not graduate UPenn until 1997, it's unclear whether he engaged in Optional Practical Training (OPT), a temporary work authorization often granted to international students in the U.S., during this time. In a 2013 South by Southwest (SXSW) keynote address, Musk described obtaining his H-1B visa , a temporary nonimmigrant legal work authorization that allowed him to work for U.S. companies after completing his studies. However, he didn't mention when he secured the H-1B visa: \" I came out to Silicon Valley to do a Ph.D. at Stanford [University in 1995], in applied physics and material science to work on ultra-capacitors for use in electric cars. And that's what I was going to do, and then I decided to put that on hold to start a company. But since I already had my undergrad, I could then get a H-1B visa and that kinda thing. So, the H-1B visa requires a degree. But other than that, if that wasn't the case, I probably would've stopped education sooner. \" Below is a snippet of the longer interview from SXSW, shared to X in 2022. Misinterpretation and the 'Gray Area' Kimbal Musk's comments in 2013, from which the rumors about Elon Musk's immigration status evidently sprang, may have been hyperbolic. Legal gray areas can sometimes arise with nonimmigrant temporary visas, especially if administrative delays occur between visa statuses, but no concrete evidence shows Musk unlawfully residing in the U.S. during this period. Since our initial fact-check in 2016, public interest in Musk's immigration status has persisted, particularly with the meme's resurgence in 2024. Updated sources further confirm that while Musk's immigration status may have been complex at certain points, and despite claims made by The Washington Post, no credible evidence supports that he was an \"illegal immigrant,\" in his brother's words. In sum, the claim that Elon Musk once held \"illegal\" status in the U.S. remains unproven. Musk's joke about being in a \"gray area\" hints at complexities but doesn't constitute evidence. Available evidence indicates he followed a legal path through student visas and H-1B temporary employment visas, allowing him and his brother to establish Zip2 in 1995. Musk later became a U.S. citizen in 2002, though the full details of his prior legal status remain partially unverified. There is no credible evidence that he was ever fully \"illegal\" during his more than three decades in the U.S. We will continue to monitor this story for any additional documentation or insights into his early visa status, and we will update this article as more information becomes available. Snopes' archives contributed to this report.\n\nSo, was Elon Musk ever truly an undocumented immigrant in the U.S., or does this story have more nuance?\n\nSnopes reexamined the claim about Musk being a former undocumented immigrant, searching for any new developments in the eight years since we first explored the claim about his U.S. legal status.\n\nMusk's Murky Immigration Timeline\n\nN ew discussions around Musk's immigration journey were likely prompted by the recirculation of that interview in early 2024, perhaps due to his comments surrounding unchecked migration to the U.S. For example, in February 2024, Musk tweeted the following message, which had received nearly 33 million views as of this writing:\n\n(Elon Musk/X)\n\nHowever, on Sept. 29, 2024, Musk followed up with another post that many interpreted as anti-migrant, in which he claimed, \"T he Biden/Harris administration has been flying 'asylum seekers', who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona.

      "article_title": "'90s Throwback: When Furbys Caused National Security Fears",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nMultiple news outlets reported on the supposed ban, citing an internal NSA memo. Snopes reached out to the agency, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense and Hasbro (the toy's manufacturer), seeking a copy of that document for independent verification. We will update this report when, or if, we receive responses.\n\nWhen it first hit toy stores in 1998, Furby was an immediate sensation. The animatronic furball would eventually be recognized by Time Magazine as one of “ History’s Best Toys .” And just as it spiked in popularity among children looking for a new robotic friend, security officials were reportedly concerned over the robot’s potential to record top-secret information.\n\nSince 1999, claims online have circulated about the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) supposedly banning Furbys from its premises over fears the toy could be used as a spying tool. Media outlets across the world — including the BBC , The Guardian , CNN , CBS News , and The Independent , among others — reported on the supposed ban.\n\nAll such stories stemmed from reporting by The Washington Post. On Jan. 13, 1999, The Post published an article titled “ A Toy Story of Hairy Espionage ” that read, in part:\n\nAs harried parents scrambled in the weeks before Christmas to get their hands on these homely, high-tech cyberpets that supposedly repeat what they hear, the supersecret spy agency put out a \"Furby Alert\" on its internal intranet in early December and banned the Furby from Fort Meade. \"Personally owned photographic, video and audio recording equipment are prohibited items. This includes toys, such as Furbys,' with built-in recorders that repeat the audio with synthesized sound to mimic the original signal,\" the Furby Alert warned NSA workers. \"We are prohibited from introducing these items into NSA spaces. Those who have should contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance.\n\n[...]\n\nNSA officials were worried, said one Capitol Hill source monitoring the intelligence community, \"that people would take them home and they'd start talking classified.\"\n\nSnopes did not find a record of the aforementioned NSA internal memo, evidence that would allow us to independently verify the claim. We reached out to the U.S. Department of Defense, NSA, and Hasbro (the toy's manufacturer) requesting a copy of the document and for more information on the alleged ban. As we wait for responses, we’ve rated this claim a “Research in Progress.”\n\nWhen people first brought Furbys home, the fur-covered robotic pets would initially speak and sing in “ Furbish ,\" an entirely made-up language. But, with time, the toys would eventually speak English.\n\nIt was that purported learning capability that prompted the alleged ban on Furbys across NSA properties. Officials supposedly believed the robots were potentially embedded with devices that could record and repeat sensitive information.\n\nAs of this writing, Furby has an entry in the Computer History Museum ’s artifact collection that reads (emphasis ours):\n\nThis furry toy ignited a 1998 holiday season buying frenzy, with resale prices reaching $300. Each Furby initially spoke only “Furbish” but could gradually learn English commands. It communicated with other nearby Furbies using an infrared port between its eyes.\n\nHowever, technically speaking, Furby was not actually \"learning\" new information, according to the toy's patent. Instead, the toy was pre-programmed with an English vocabulary that, over time, would be unveiled to owners as they played with them.\n\nRoger Shiffman — who was the owner of Tiger Electronics, a subsidiary of Hasbro, at the time — reportedly refuted NSA allegations that the toy could record or repeat classified information. At the time, CBS News reported Shiffman said, “Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever” and didn’t “learn” anything — the toys just repeated already-programmed information.\n\nFurthermore, a May 1999 research article published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited a Jan. 21, 1999, Hasbro press release that supposedly attributed the below quote to Shiffman:\n\n… although Furby is a clever toy, it does not record or mimic voices. Each Furby is preprogrammed to react to its environment. The NSA did not do their homework. Furby is not a spy!\n\n(Snopes was unable to locate that purported press release online for its viewing, though asked Hasbro about it.) Additionally, to confirm whether Furby was able to record audio it supposedly hears, Snopes tracked down the toy’s U.S. patent . It described infrared transmitters and receivers, like those found in television remote controls, to react to external stimuli. Sensors allowed the toy to move and respond to stimuli, as well as interact with other Furbys, while a single motor allowed for the toy's movements.\n\nThe patent read, in part:\n\nThe toy utilizes sensors for detecting sensory inputs which dictate the movements of the body parts in response to the sensed inputs. The sensors also allow several of the toys to interact with each other. The body parts are driven for movement by a single motor which is relatively small in terms of its power requirements given the large number of different movements that it powers.\n\nSnopes found no mention of recording devices contained within the toy.\n\n(US Patents)\n\nAccording to a 2019 article published by the technology outlet, IEEE Spectrum , Furby’s source code was written by computer engineers David Hampton and Wayne Schulz to run on a variation of the 6502 microprocessor — the 8-bit chip that powered the Apple II, Commodore 64 and BBC Micro.\n\nAccording to a post written by Terry Kraus, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) historian, Furby was also temporarily banned on all aircraft in the late 90s over concerns that its technology could disrupt equipment. At the time, the FAA denied the rumor, saying it recommended the toy be stowed and used like other small electronic devices on flights. There have also been rumors of Navy officials prohibiting the toy at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine.\n\nIn 2024, you can purchase a Furby for $69.99"

      "text": "About this rating\n\nNikola Tesla was an inventor, an engineer, a futurist, a physicist and — according to an frequently shared viral image — a swim instructor.\n\nA photograph purportedly showing the famous inventor at the beach has been shared with a variety of captions over the years. The Twitter account \"History Photographed, \"for instance, once claimed that it showed a young Tesla teaching a girl to swim in 1900, \" Weird History \" labeled the inventor a \"swim instructor,\" while \"The History Lovers Club\" merely noted that this was a young Tesla at the beach:\n\nNone of these captions are accurate, however, as the man in the photograph is not Nikola Tesla. According to the Museum of the City of New York, this image was taken in 1898 , and shows a man (identified as a \"swimming instructor\") and a woman (identified as a \"bather\") at Midland Beach in Staten Island.\n\nThe man in this image does bear a passing resemblance to the famed inventor. However, Tesla was about 42 years old in 1898 (when this photograph was taken), while the man in the image appears to be quite younger. Here's a comparison of the \"Swim Instructor\" and an image of Tesla that was taken in 1896:\n\nOne notable difference is the hairline, which is unlikely to stop receding (and in fact grow back) over a period of two years. The ears are also markedly different.\n\nIt is also highly unlikely that Tesla had the time, inclination, or financial need to secure a job as a swim instructor around that time. Tesla already had several successful patents and was operating several laboratories around New York City by 1898."

      "article_title": "Miracle Carburetor",
      "text": "Claim: A miraculous car that gets 200 miles to the gallon is sold by mistake then reclaimed by the factory and is never seen again.\n\nFALSE\n\nExamples:\n\n[Collected via e-mail, 1999]\n\nA retiring General Motors employee, after many years of service, receives a car as a retirement gift. (as well as a nice pension, etc.). So he is given permission to select a car from the lot there at the factory. He selects a Chevrolet Caprice, a big, luxury car. After receiving it, he is satisfied with his choice. After all, who wouldn't enjoy driving around in a roomy, comfortable car. After driving it for a while, he noticed something quite odd ... a car like this usually consumes a substantial amount of fuel, but the gas gauge hardly moves at all.\n\nAfter a few weeks, he gets suspicious. Things like this don't happen. Being the company man he is, he returns it to the factory. Explaining this to the service tech must've caused some strange looks, but they took it in anyway. After he got his car back, he noticed it got the typical gas mileage of a comparable car. Could've this car had some secret \"modifications\" that allowed him to drive for weeks, on the same tank of gas? Detroit's automakers have purportedly seized, er.. bought out patents of items that improve gasoline mileage like the 100 mpg carburetor, etc. Maybe the R&D department at GM put this theory to practice, and this was an example.\n\n[Collected via e-mail, 1997]\n\nA couple journeys from Western Canada to Detroit to buy a new car and presumably save shipping costs while having a vacation in the States at the same time. Driving back to the prairies, they find to their astonishment that the gas gauge is not moving down to \"empty\" even though they've been driving for hours. Arriving home some thousands of miles away from Detroit, they have only refilled the tank once or twice.\n\nA few days after returning, the husband looks out at his driveway in the morning to find two mysterious men tinkering with his car (the hood is up). Running out, they race off; he checks under the hood, finds nothing amiss, and concludes it's just vandals or would-be thieves whom he was fortunate to apprehend before any damage was done. BUT, when they drive the car, they find their gas mileage is now normal.\n\nVariations: The miraculous car legend ends one of four ways:\n\nOrigins: The legend of the miracle high-mileage automobile has been around longer than most of our readers, with a version set it Philadelphia having appeared in a 1948 newspaper. (Even at that time, the story proved unverifiable, with the article's writer identifying it as such and passing it along only as an example of a current rumor\n\nsweeping through the community.) Since that early sighting of more than half a century ago, the legend has gone on to enthrall audience after audience as each couple of years sees it pop up anew.\n\nIts origins are as strange as the story itself. Between 1928 and 1935, Charles Nelson Pogue, an inventor from Canada, applied for numerous patents for what he claimed was a new type of carburetor that supposedly completely vaporized gasoline before introducing it to the cylinders, thereby extracting a great deal more energy from the fuel. According to the Pogue patent description, fuel was introduced into the engine in this vaporous \"dry\" state rather than in the normal droplet-laden \"wet\" state, thus combining more readily with air, making it burn with far greater efficiency. Better combustion combined with the raising of the engine's operating temperature from 160°F to 180°F were said to be responsible for vastly improved fuel economy.\n\nSo much for the techno-talk. The Pogue carburetor was touted as getting 200+ miles to the gallon. Glowing reports about this miracle of ingenuity's making a 1,879 mile trip on 14.5 gallons appeared in the May 1936 issue of Canadian Automotive Trade magazine, reports which Pogue later denied. A manager of a Winnipeg auto dealership claimed he had driven a Pogue-equipped car 217 miles on a gallon of gasoline. A different dealer principal claimed to have driven 26 miles on a pint of fuel.\n\nThe story snowballed onward from those breathless testimonials as one rumor quickly followed on the heels of another. Thieves were reputed to have broken into Pogue's shop and made off with three of his carburetors. There was talk of armed guards and wolfhounds guarding the shop and the now-famous inventor. Wealthy backers (from Winnipeg or Toronto, depending on whom you heard the story from) were rumored\n\nto be bankrolling Pogue, but the arrangements mysteriously fell through. Ford of Canada was said to have bought the invention outright. All in all it was a very exciting time.\n\nAlas, one can get by on mere smoke and mirrors for only so long. Those with sense enough to not be deafened by the hyperbole were not long kept at bay with tales of wolfhounds, thieves, and mysterious briefcase-toting moneymen. They wanted to see the carburetor.\n\nThat, of course, was never permitted.\n\nNo one reputable was allowed to see the mechanical miracle in action, let alone have a chance to measure its results. After the initial excitement over Pogue's 1936 announcement had faded, more serious types began to openly doubt that the carburetor would work as described. In the December 1936 issue of Automotive Industries magazine, its engineering editor, P.M. Heldt, said of a sketch of the Pogue carburetor: \"The sketch fails to show any features hitherto unknown in carburetor practice, and absolutely gives no warrant for crediting the remarkable results claimed.\" Other journalists were beginning to voice similar opinions.\n\nIn response to calls to put up or shut up, Pogue's miracle carburetor was heard of no more. Faced with the choice of believing someone had made claims his invention couldn't later live up to or that a monied bad guy had bought up a technology to forever keep it off the market, at least some chose to believe the suppression theory. That the carburetor never made it to the public, they said, was proof enough of its existence.\n\nThose 1930s news stories breathlessly trumpeting Pogue's miracle of technology form the basis of the economical carburetor legend now before us. As gas prices\n\nfluctuate, our dependence on fossil fuels is driven home time and again. Who wouldn't long for a miracle of engineering that would free us from the tyranny of the gas pump? And thus the groundwork for belief is laid.\n\nAs sometimes happens in the world of urban legends, desire for something to be true transforms a rumor into certainty that this very thing is fact. Over the years, our legend about a 200 mpg car has bobbed to the surface in community after community, been debunked in numerous respected publications, and bobbed right back up in the wake of those debunkings. The need to believe in this wondrous technology and the evil car manufacturers who are deliberately withholding it from the market appears too strong to combat.\n\nA bit of rational thought should be all that's needed to lay this legend to rest. Why would the car manufacturers at all care about keeping such a technological advance away from consumers? Unlike the petroleum companies, they've no vested interest in how much fuel a car uses. An automaker's self interest is best served by getting the newest irresistible technology to the consumer before his competitors do. If any one of them possessed the secret of the 200 mpg car, he'd have rushed it into production, hoping to beat his competitors to the punch.\n\nThose who are tempted to believe the Evil Government is responsible for keeping this miracle out of our hands should reflect for a moment on the current state of world politics. The government of the United States would like nothing better than to throw off the yoke of dependence upon foreign oil. A miraculous carburetor would grant that freedom, allowing Americans to continue to enjoy current levels of use without the need to go hat in hand to OPEC or even those dastardly Canadians. The domestic supply would be more than enough.\n\nThough rarely is this tale told about anything other than a gas-miserly carburetor, this version describes a miraculous lightbulb:\n\nIt was around 1920, shortly after he had married, when the old man originally purchased the light bulb from a small store in town. It appeared to be a normal light bulb. However, when after sixty years it was still going strong, he decided to write to the manufacturers and tell them of this remarkable phenomenon.\n\nBy return a reply came from the company indicating that they were very interested in the bulb and would like to send someone to see it. Eventually, one of the directors of the firm called and, instead of just showing interest, offered to buy it for £1,000.\n\nThe old man, of course, refused, as the light bulb had given him good service. However, his curiousity was certainly aroused — why so much money for his light bulb? The director could provide no plausible explanation as to why they were willing to offer so much for the bulb, so the old man decided to explore this mystery further.\n\nWith the help of a solicitor friend he did a little investigating and discovered that in the 1920s this particular light-bulb manufacturer had bought and tested the patent for an everlasting bulb. Only a few of these bulbs were made and the company, finding the invention worked, destroyed the bulbs and suppressed the idea — after all, it would have put them out of business. Unknown to the company one of the lights had accidentally become mixed up with a batch of ordinary bulbs and this was the light bulb which had lit the old man's kitchen for the past sixty years.\n\n(Sometimes lore collides with reality: A long-lived light bulb has been burning since 1901 and currently lights a fire station in Livermore, California.)\n\nBarbara \"gasoline allied\" Mikkelson\n\nOrigins: The legend about the need to suppress the steam-driven carburetor that can produce 200 mpg to protect the oil industry surfaces in an episode of the TV series Spoils of Babylon (\"The Foundling: The War Within; original air date 9 January 2014).\n\nLast updated: 26 June 2014\n\nSources:\n\nBrunvand, Jan Harold.

Does this mean they have the right to demand blood samples from any victims?  Can they force those on government health care to take experimental Ebola vaccines that they develop?  Is the CDC purposely allowing Ebola to enter the country in order to cause a \"run\" on a newly developed vaccine?\n\nOrigins: The 2014 Ebola outbreak began in December 2013 and is the deadliest recorded since the discovery of ebolaviruses in 1976. The severity and scope of the 2014 Ebola outbreak has caused significant global concern over the threat posed by the disease, and a number of rumors have resulted.\n\nOne pervasive strain of rumors centers around \"ownership\" of what many understand to be the Ebola virus: more specifically, ownership of a patent granted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2010, Patent No. CA2741523A1 . An abstract for that patent reads:\n\nThe invention provides the isolated human Ebola (hEbola) viruses denoted as Bundibugyo (EboBun) deposited with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"; Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America) on November 26, 2007 and accorded an accession number 200706291."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nFor years, posts on Reddit , X and other platforms have claimed that the reason the tops of ballpoint pen caps are perforated is to save lives:\n\nOther posts on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) claimed the same thing, in English and other languages . As we'll see, the claim is true, though Bic didn't start to vent its pens until 1990.\n\nSaving Lives\n\nThe idea of perforating the caps of pens appears to have started in the United Kingdom, where a new safety standard was adopted in 1990 ( BS 7272 ). Between 1970 and 1984, nine children in the United Kingdom died as a result of choking on pen caps. \"No such deaths have occurred since the U.K. adopted the international safety standard,\" a 2004 report said.\n\nIn an email, Bic spokeswoman Astrid Canevet said the company began to perforate the caps of its emblematic product, the Bic Cristal, that same year. \"BIC, always concerned with the safety of its products and its consumers, decided to apply this British norm everywhere in the world,\" she said.\n\nIt now exists as such in compliance with International Organization for Standardization norm 11540 — first implemented in 1993 , then revised in 2014 and more recently in 2021 — relative to \"requirements to reduce the risk of asphyxiation from caps for writing and marking instruments. It relates to such instruments which in normal or foreseeable circumstances are likely to be used by children up to the age of 14 years.\" This norm was established in response to the several incidents of children choking on unperforated pen caps.\n\nAs the company stated on its website's FAQ :\n\nOur vented caps comply with international safety standards ISO11540. These standards attempt to minimize the risk to children from accidental inhalation of pen caps. Traditionally the pen cap served only to protect the pen point. These vented caps allow more air to circulate around the pen point when the pen is capped. This further adds to the quality and overall performance of the pen.\n\nCanevet gave more details about what pen makers might do to various models of ballpoint pens in response to this norm:\n\nThe cap might have a single hole, or several holes placed at the top of the cap (which is often the case for markers), or have a large cap (more than 1.6 millimeters in diameter), which is considered too large to be swallowed.\n\nBic's History\n\nThe Bic Cristal pen was created in France in 1950, after manufacturer and Bic founder Baron Marcel Bich acquired the rights to a patent created by László Bíró. The Bic Cristal was still being produced in France as of this writing, following a proprietary process . The writing ball is 1 millimeter in diameter, almost as resistant as a diamond and made of tungsten carbide. The ink must have the viscosity of honey. The hole on the clear side of the pen allows for air to pass to balance the air pressure so the ink can come out. A classic Bic Cristal can write up to 3 kilometers . In 2001, the iconic pen, still the world's most sold, entered the Museum of Modern Art .\n\nThe pen is, of course, made mostly of plastic. In response to environmental concerns — and to mark the pen's 70th anniversary — the company introduced in 2020 a rechargeable version of it, with a body made of metal and a cap made of recycled plastic.\n\nNow, most ballpoint pen manufacturers comply with ISO11540."

    "claim": "Peanut oil is secretly present in childhood vaccines and flu shots.",

      "article_title": "Are Pharmaceutical Companies Hiding the Presence of Peanut Oil in Vaccines?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nAmong the many epidemiological trends blamed on vaccines, one of the lesser known fallacies is that they are the cause of an increased incidence of childhood peanut allergies in the United States and other nations. Alternative health website and “ alien false flag ” watchdog Natural News, for example, used this argument in a 13 February 2017 story arguing that President Trump’s allegedly exemplary health is, in part, thanks to his never having received a flu shot:\n\nHave you ever wondered why hundreds of thousands of U.S. children are allergic to peanuts? A hundred years ago, peanut allergies were unheard of, yet today, as many as 2 million U.S. children are allergic to them. What changed? The flu shot.\n\nThough articles and individuals attempting to make this link propose a variety of mechanisms for the ways in which an inoculation could contribute to the development of peanut allergies, each relies on the false premise that vaccines (childhood and/or influenza) contain undisclosed traces of peanut oil.\n\nThe most common narrative found online is that peanut oil is used as what is known as an adjuvant (a chemical that increases the body's immune response to an inoculation) but loopholes in the legal system allow this information to remain undisclosed.\n\nThis assertion appears to have its roots in the 2011 book The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by Heather Fraser, which has a section about the potential presence of peanut oil adjuvants in vaccines. Fraser attempts to argue that some kinds of adjuvants in injections (not specifically childhood vaccines) may have, through poorly understood mechanisms, sensitized children to peanut and other allergies. This specific chapter (and the evidence it cites) appears to be the basis for a number peanut oil claims on numerous anti - vaccine websites .\n\nThe web site VaccineInformationNetwork.com summarizes that narrative in a way that is representative of many posts:\n\nMany different substances have been used as adjuvants over the last 100 years, and the scientists have been constantly on the lookout for more dangerous substances which produce extreme immune reactions in the human body, until one day they stumbled upon a substance that delivered the kind of deadly reaction they were looking for: Peanuts.\n\nPeanuts were first used as an adjuvant in vaccines in the mid-60s. We know this because the startling admission was made in the New York Times on 18 Sep 1964, where the author described how a newly patented ingredient including peanut oil was being added to the flu vaccine as an adjuvant in order to ‘enhance the vaccines strength’. Peanut oil became the model for subsequent vaccines, and by the 1980s it had become the preferred adjuvant for the manufacturers.\n\nToday, peanut oil is a common trade secret ingredient used in vaccine adjuvants. They claim it as a trade secret so their competitors wont [sic] ‘steal their vaccine formulas’, but in reality they do it so they don’t have to list it as an ingredient, in the hope that the unaware public wont realise it is the cause.\n\nWhile the Vaccine Information Network post is a bit more dramatic in its language, both that post and the book from which that information is derived make a number of claims that require investigation:\n\nVaccines Have Used Peanut Adjuvants Since The 1960s — False\n\nThe notion that vaccines containing peanut oil adjuvants were introduced to the public, as presented in Fraser’s book, relies on a 1964 New York Times report about a clinical trial conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck of a flu vaccine that contained a new peanut-oil based adjuvant given the name \"Adjuvant 65\", which at the time seemed to show considerable promise:\n\nA pharmaceutical manufacturer has developed a vaccine that it predicts will considerably lengthen immunity from influ­enza and other virus infections, thereby requiring fewer “shots.”\n\nThe key ingredient, called Adjuvant 65, which contains peanut oil, was patented this week for Merck & Co., Inc., by Dr. Allen F. Woodhour and Dr. Thomas B. Stim. [...]\n\nThe current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine re­ports favorably on studies in which 880 persons received killed influenza virus in Adju­vant 65.\n\nThis article, however, in no way demonstrates that vaccines commonly contained peanut-oil adjuvants in the 1960s; In fact, it makes it clear that they were not even approved for public use in the United States, explicitly stating “the new vaccine is still under study and is not yet licensed for general use.”\n\nThis kind of bait-and-switch is also applied to another New York Times article from 1966. Here, crucially, Fraser says that in 1966, \"Merck introduced this novel peanut oil additive to the public in a flu vaccine”, implying the product was approved for public use. The only problem is the story she cited concerns a conference presentation by the same researchers in the 1964 study, and it once again makes it clear that it is not a publicly available concoction, but instead still undergoing testing:\n\nStudies of an additive to an influenza vaccine show that it increases the potency and duration of the vaccine's protective effect. This was reported today at an international conference on vaccines here that is sponsored by the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization.\n\nThe additive — called an adjuvant — has been tested on 15,000 adults and children. To date, the studies suggest that use of the adjuvant produces a high level of immunity that lasts for several years. Ordinarily, it is believed that flu vaccine produced from a killed virus produces an immunity that is likely to last only one season.\n\nWhen asked for clarification, Fraser told us via email that she did not intend to suggest that Adjuvant 65 was ever used in American vaccines:\n\nAdjuvant 65-4 [the specific formulation tested then] was never licensed for use in the US. It was used in vaccines in clinical trials, some large scale over a period of at least 10 years. I did not mean to suggest that this adjuvant was used outside of clinical trials in the US.\n\nIntent or not, it appears likely that many anti-vaccine websites have taken these two citations as proof that Adjuvant 65, or some peanut oil containing progeny, is and remains a commonly used ingredient in vaccines. In reality, however, Adjuvant 65 was never approved for use in the United States and many other countries due to concerns about its toxicity. No human vaccines presently contain the compound.\n\nPeanut Oil “Became a Model” for Subsequent Adjuvants in Vaccines — False\n\nThis wording is vague as it does not define what “became a model” actually means. One thing it does not mean, however, is that the failure of Adjuvant 65 resulted in a number of other more successful and widely used peanut based vaccine adjuvants, as there has not been a single such product licensed for use in human vaccines.\n\nA more accurate narrative concerning vegetable oil based adjuvants and the relative importance of Adjuvant 65 in medical history can be found in a 1993 review of the topic, which describes the efforts to create vegetable oil adjuvants (which can be metabolized by the body) as a replacement for mineral oil adjuvants (which, because they cannot, lead to health concerns):\n\nVarious kinds of emulsions with different oil samples have been evaluated in a search for a stable, non-toxic and better adjuvant. As an alternative to mineral oil emulsion adjuvants, [the research group associated with Merck] designed a vegetable oil adjuvant, 'Adjuvant 65', consisting of 86% peanut oil, 10% Arlacel A [...] as emulsifier and 4% aluminium monostearate as stabilizer [...].\n\nWhen tried in humans, this adjuvant appeared to be safe and potent but with less adjuvanticity than [the most common mineral oil adjuvant]. Although Adjuvant 65 was licensed for general use in one country, its use was discontinued due to reactogenicity for man [...]\n\nDespite the absence of tumour formation in [...] several thousand persons inoculated with Adjuvant 65 influenza vaccine followed for 10 years, further work on these adjuvants of vegetable oil with Arlacel A slowed down or even stopped when it was shown in one report that Arlacel A [might be carcinogenic in one strain of lab mice]. [...]\n\n[One research group] developed an adjuvant with sesame oil double emulsion without Arlacel A which could be metabolized. This preparation had a good adjuvant effect on the antibody response of mice. Another preparation containing highly refined peanut oil emulsified in aqueous arbovirus vaccine with glycerol and lecithin increased antibody production and induced protective immunity in several experimental animals. Unlike Arlacel A, glycerol and lecithin are readily metabolized normal host constituents. This formula of peanut oil, glycerol and lecithin has been described as relatively non-reactogenic in tissues. However [as of 1993], there is still no oil emulsion adjuvant which may be used in humans.\n\nIn her book, Fraser cites a single research paper testing a peanut-oil based adjuvant in a variety of animal models, as well as a handful of patent applications, to defend the claim that it was “a model” for other adjuvants at the time.\n\nWhile it is unclear what became of that particular adjuvant in that study, no peanut-oil adjuvant has ever been licensed for use in American vaccines, meaning it likely didn't go anywhere. At least one of the patents Fraser cites, incidentally, certainly didn’t go anywhere — it is currently listed as expired because of lack of payment for administrative fees. Far from being a model for new adjuvants, peanut oil could more accurately be described as a dead end.\n\nBy the 1980s Peanut Oil Was the Preferred Adjuvant for Vaccines — False\n\nThis claim, incidentally, is not made in Fraser’s book, but is included on the VaccineInformationNetwork.com post, and may stem from a misreading of her statement that the inclusion of peanut oil in vaccine adjuvant patents became \"common practice\".\n\nRegardless of the relative meaninglessness of the term \"common practice\" in this context (or the irrelevance of a patent application to a larger discussion of epidemiological trends) claiming that peanut oil was a preferred adjuvant for vaccines by the 1980s is about as \"alternative fact\" as they come. As discussed above, efforts to develop vegetable oil based adjuvants essentially stopped in the late 1970s. There are, currently, only two types of adjuvants approved for U.S. use: aluminum salts and a single, animal-derived oil emulsion used only in the Cervarix vaccine and only since 2009.\n\nFar from being the preferred adjuvant beginning in the 1980s, peanut oil adjuvants have never been licensed for human use in US vaccines, and are currently not licensed for human vaccine use anywhere else.\n\nThere Are Loopholes That Make it Legal for Vaccine Manufacturers to Hide the Presence of Peanut Oil from the Public — False\n\nIn case the complete and total lack of evidence supporting the claim that peanut oil can be found in vaccines convinced you that they were peanut free, anti-vaccine advocates also throw in a burden-of-proof logical fallacy to contend with: that pharmaceutical companies are doing it secretly and there is literally no way to know for sure.\n\nA number of websites make the argument that there are legal loopholes that allow pharmaceutical companies to “get away” with putting peanut oil in vaccines. Fraser makes that argument in her book, too, but without any supporting evidence:\n\nHowever, with the sharp rise in lawsuits against vaccine makers starting in the mid-1970s, public knowledge of exact ingredients in vaccines or other pediatric injections became circumscribed. Vaccine makers no longer excitedly announced new ingredients as Merck did in 1964 with the peanut-oil-based Adjuvant 65-4. The public had no way of knowing fully what was being injected into their children.\n\nThe response to the increased number of lawsuits was not to reduce regulations regarding disclosure of ingredients, but to set up a “no-fault” vaccine court to settle lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines. This court significantly reduced pharmaceutical companies’ liability, which would make them less concerned with lawsuits, not more. United States law remains quite clear on the labeling requirements for vaccines, according to Section 610.61 of Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nThis code explicitly requires the presence of any sensitizing substance (proteins left over from a vegetable oil, for instance) as well as the specific adjuvant present (along with pretty much every chemical that would have been used at any point, even if no longer present) to be clearly defined:\n\nThe following items shall appear on the label affixed to each package containing a product: [...]\n\n(l) Known sensitizing substances , or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n\n(m) The type and calculated amount of antibiotics added during manufacture;\n\n(n) The inactive ingredients when a safety factor, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n\n(o) The adjuvant , if present;\n\n(p) The source of the product when a factor in safe administration;\n\n(q) The identity of each microorganism used in manufacture, and, where applicable, the production medium and the method of inactivation, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n\nThe complete contents of all US approved vaccines can be found on the CDC web site .\n\nOk, So It’s Not in Adjuvants, But They Do “Brew” Vaccines in Peanut Oil — False\n\nSome venues avoid the concept of peanut oil based adjuvants entirely. These publications, most notably Natural News (which referenced a series of posts authored by a “doctor” who, by their own disclaimer , may not exist), instead claim that peanut oil is (or could be) used as a “growth medium” in the production of vaccines, which could then leave undetectable traces of peanut proteins or other allergens that companies would be under no obligation to disclose:\n\nThe influenza vaccine is brewed in peanut oil that’s not listed as an ingredient because only “trace amounts” remain – not enough according to the FDA and CDC to harm people. Peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s, but because it doesn’t “show up” in the final vaccine product, the manufacturers are allowed to leave it off the package inserts.\n\nPeanut oil is just one “growth medium” that vaccine manufacturers use to make vaccines, like egg embryo (protein) and casein (milk). This is what they use to make MMR and influenza vaccines.\n\nBy asserting that \"peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s\" — a reference to the previously mentioned trial study — Natural News may be conflating adjuvants with growth media. A \"growth medium\" is simply a concoction of nutrients, sugars and other hydrocarbons that help either bacterial cells or cells hosting a virus to survive. In a post explaining why animal products are sometimes used to achieve this goal, the Food and Drug Administration describes the basics:\n\nVaccines contain either killed or weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, or components of these that stimulate a response by the body's immune system, which then protects against the development of disease. In the late 19th century, microbiologists began to grow bacteria in the laboratory. The early bacteriologists tried to mimic as closely as possible the environment in an infected person's tissues by using solutions containing sugars, salts, and various meat extracts to make \"growth media.\" These kinds of conditions were quite successful in growing bacteria and then viruses in the lab, because these media supplied the many necessary nutrients. Although synthetic media have been developed for growth of many medically important microorganisms, some still require additional nutrients which are easily provided by animal-derived products such as serum and blood. Viral vaccines are produced in living cells, which, similarly, require the addition of complex growth media components, such as fetal calf serum.\n\nThe generally untestable argument made here is that nothing is stopping pharmaceutical companies from using peanut oil in their growth media. From a legal standpoint, however, this too is false. As mentioned above, U.S. law requires “the identity of each microorganism used in manufacture, and, where applicable, the production medium ” to be disclosed.\n\nThe argument that pharmaceutical companies don’t need to report things that appear only in trace amounts or not at all is equally false. According to the disclaimer on the CDC’s list of vaccine ingredients:\n\nThis table includes not only vaccine ingredients (e.g., adjuvants and preservatives), but also substances used during the manufacturing process, including vaccine-production media, that are removed from the final product and present only in trace quantities.\n\nWhile some of these media are patented products, their method of production and ingredients are publicly known — and peanut oil free.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite all of the above hoops one must jump through to debunk this myth, the basic facts are quite simple. Arguments suggesting that peanut oil is present in vaccines of any kind rely on using a clinical trial for a peanut-oil based adjuvant in the 1960s as evidence that peanut oil adjuvants are and have been in widespread use.\n\nThose trials were a failure. No peanut oil based adjuvants (or growth media) are used in human vaccines, and there are no legal loopholes (at least in the United States) that would allow pharmaceutical companies to avoid disclosure of different compounds used in their production. In response to our inquiry about the claims made in her book, Fraser told us:\n\nWhile the oil has a history of use in pharmaceuticals, I have no evidence that it is used in childhood vaccines.\n\nDespite this, Fraser’s book is still often offered as the definitive source for the “fact” that childhood vaccines (or flu shots) contain peanut oil."

      "article_title": "Why Is There a Little Plastic 'Table' in Your Pizza Delivery Box?",
      "text": "If you've ever gotten a pizza delivery, there is often a plastic item in the center of a pie that looks a lot like a tiny table, often with three legs, or prongs. This is usually placed directly on top of the pizza while the latter is hot, often leaving it covered in grease and sauce. The purpose of this \"miniature table\" has been the subject of online debates.\n\nContrary to what some have supposed, it is not decorative, and was not designed to resemble a table. It actually has a practical purpose. According to some reports , the origins of the plastic gizmo can be traced to Carmela Vitale, a woman in Long Island who filed a patent for it in the '80s. Called a \"pizza saver\" in the industry, it's intended to protect the pizza from sticking to the sagging roof of a cardboard pizza box. The patent filed by Vitale in 1983 details how it works:\n\nA temperature resistant molded plastic device is described for use in boxes or packages such as pizza boxes where there is a tendency of large cover portions to sag downwardly to damage the soft pizza or other packaged products. In use, the saver is positioned near the center of the package to support the box cover for protecting the contents.\n\nWhen a hot pizza is placed inside one of the flat cardboard boxes commonly used for delivery and takeout, the roof of the box starts to sag the more it is exposed to the heat and steam of the pizza. While Vitale called the product a \"package saver,\" it really prevents the pizza toppings from getting stuck to the cardboard, so the term \"pizza saver\" seems more apt .\n\nThe patent also states:\n\nDue to the quality of the board and their large size, there is a tendency of the covers to sag or to be easily depressed at their center portions so that they may damage or mark the pies or cakes during storage or delivery.\n\nAccordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an easily manufactured, relatively inexpensive, lightweight article which is placed on the pie or cake within the package to support the central portion of the package cover during delivery.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide an improved means for protecting articles such as pizza and other pies or cakes from damage during delivery in boxes.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive device for protecting pizza and other pies or cakes during delivery.\n\nThe pizza saver was intended to minimize any contact with the pizza:\n\nIn its preferred form, as illustrated, the saver 1 has spaced vertical legs 2 connected to a cover support 3. The lower portions of the legs 4 have a minimal cross section to minimize any marking of to the protected article 5 and they are also made thin for minimizing the volume of plastic required. The cover support 3 of the saver 1 also preferably has a minimum volume by consisting of a spoke-like arrangement of radially oriented leg supports 6 molded to extend from a central portion 7.\n\nEater tried to reach out to Vitale's family and the lawyers who helped her filed the patent but no one provided any additional information. The patent was approved in 1985 and lapsed in 1993.\n\nSince then, those little pizza-saving tables have become ubiquitous, with dozens of companies manufacturing and selling them to restaurants and pizza-makers everywhere."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn January 2021, the website America's Best Pics shared a meme claiming that a prostitute named \"Gerda Puridle\" invented long eyelashes in 1880s:\n\nThe woman in this picture was not a prostitute, her name was not Gerda Puridle, and the claim about the origins of artificial eyelashes was made up out of whole cloth.\n\nThe woman featured in this meme is Alice Regnault, a French actress and novelist who rose to prominence in the 1870s. This photograph appears to have been taken by French photographer Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (better known as \"Nadar\") circa 1879. It was included in a guide published a few years later called \"Les Actrices de Paris\" (The Actresses of Paris) by Emile Bergerat:\n\nHere's how Regnault was described in \"Les Actrices de Paris\" (translated via Google and edited for clarity): \"An intelligent and flexible actress who, through commitment and hard work, has managed to escape a reputation as a 'pretty woman' — where the love of the masses kept her, as in a prison. So has the fine and elegant Mademoiselle Régnault proven herself, for some time now.\"\n\nWhile Regnault laid claim to titles such as actress, novelist, and journalist, she did not invent elongated eyelashes. According to beauty magazine Marie Claire , humans were tinkering with and beautifying their eyelashes in ancient Egypt, though it wasn't until the late 1800s that people figured out that they could lengthen their eyelashes with human hair. An 1882 volume of \" Medical Record \" explained the process of creating artificial eyelashes:\n\nFalse Eyelashes - Labouchere says in Truth: The Parisians have found out how to make false eyelashes. I do not speak of the vulgar and well-known trick of darkening the rim round the eye with all kinds of dirty composition, or the more artistic plan of doing so to the inside of the lid. No, they actually draw a fine needle, threaded with dark hair, through the skin of the eyelid, forming long loops, and after the process if over - I am told it is a painless one - a splendid dark fringe veils the coquette's eyes.\"\n\nWhile the practice of artificially elongating eyelashes started in the late 1800s, the first patent for an artificial eyelash wasn't secured until 1911. Here's a look at inventor Anna Taylor's artificial eyelash patent:\n\nDespite the fact that artificial eyelashes have been around since the late 1800s, and that Taylor filed a patent in 1911, many people credit filmmaker D.W. Griffith for popularizing artificial eyelashes with his 1916 film \"Intolerance.\" The New York Times reported :\n\nOne day in 1916, while filming \"Intolerance,\" D. W. Griffith studied an actress in a Babylonian costume and felt something wasn't right. Seena Owen's eyes, he said, should be twice as large and \"supernatural.\" He ordered his wigmaker to use spirit gum to glue a pair of lashes made from human hair onto Owen's eyelids. \"One morning she arrived at the studio with her eyes swollen nearly shut,\" the actress Lillian Gish, who was also in the movie, wrote in her memoir. \"Fortunately, Mr. Griffith had already shot the important scenes.\" Within a decade, false lashes became standard equipment for actresses — and for flappers who imitated the \"baby doll\" eyes that they saw on-screen.\n\nGish claimed that Griffith invented false eyelashes, but like many Hollywood legends, this one proves to be not exactly true. In 1911, a Canadian woman named Anna Taylor received a U.S. patent for the artificial eyelash; hers was a crescent of fabric implanted with tiny hairs. And even before that, hairdressers and makeup artists tried a similar trick. A German named Charles Nestle (nee Karl Nessler) manufactured false lashes in the early 20th century and used the profit from sales to finance his next invention — the permanent wave. By 1915, Nestle had opened a New York hair-perming salon on East 49th Street, with lashes as his sideline. Nestle promoted false eyelashes as a guard against the glare of electric lights and hired chorus girls to bat their eyes at customers. To some men of the era, it was as if a booby trap had been introduced in the war between the sexes. \"When a fair young thing looks at you mistily through her long, curling lashes, do not fall for it until you investigate,\" warned one columnist in 1921. \"The long, curling eyelashes may not be hers, except by right of purchase.\"\n\nIn short, the claim that a prostitute named Gerda Puridle invented elongated eyelashes is completely made up out of whole cloth."

      "article_title": "FACT CHECK: Was the Raggedy Ann Doll Modeled After a Child Killed by a Vaccine?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nRaggedy Ann was created in 1915 by Johnny Gruelle, whose daughter Marcella died at the age of 13 after receiving a vaccination.\n\nRaggedy Ann was patented before Marcella's death and had nothing to do with vaccine opposition.\n\nOrigin\n\nIn January 2017, Facebook pages \" The Truth About Vaccines \" and \" VacTruth.com \" shared memes promotion the notion that the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls were created as part of an anti-vaccination movement:\n\nDifferent versions of this claim had appeared as early as 2009 , and the alternative health site RealFarmacy published a 2014 article that linked Raggedy Ann with a death caused (they said) by vaccination:\n\nIn 1921, Johnny Gruelle's 8-yr old daughter was vaccinated in school without her parents' permission. Between the time she became ill from the vaccination and her death a few months later, her body was completely limp, like a rag doll. It was this sick vaccine-injured child that inspired Gruelle to create the Raggedy Ann doll.\n\nThis myth was hinted at by the Wall Street Journal in February 2015.\n\nIn general, the memes and articles advanced the claim that Raggedy Ann dolls were created by Johnny Gruelle in 1915 as symbols of the dangers and deaths purportedly associated with vaccines. The rumor clearly had sticking power and regularly made the rounds on social media, and although aspects of it may be correct, the gist of the \"vaccination\" claim is easily disputed.\n\nHistorians at doll enthusiast site DollKind.com noted that Gruelle's purported creation of a \"dead\" and \"lifeless\" tribute to his daughter with X marks over the doll's eyes were \"absurd\":\n\nRaggedy Ann has been historically associated with the anti-vaccination movement, and there is some truth and some fiction associated with this belief. The tragic truth that still wrenches our hearts to this day is that Johnny Gruelle's little daughter died after being given a mandatory smallpox vaccination at school. The child was just 13 years old, and her loss was devastating to Johnny Gruelle, who then became a proponent of the anti-vaccination movement. However, there is an absurd school of thought that asserts that the Raggedy Ann doll was created as a limp and lifeless-looking creature to symbolize Gruelle's dead child. This is certainly not the case, and Gruelle's registered patent of the Raggedy Ann character occurred right around the time of Marcella's death. Evidence indicates that he had been working on perfecting Raggedy Ann prior to this tragedy in his family.\n\nOn the Raggedy Land web site, author Patricia Hall noted that the legend was one of many associated with Raggedy Ann, a brand popular with children for several decades:\n\nJohnny Gruelle's little rag dolls have also found themselves at the center of several legend cycles -- groups of stories that, while containing kernels of truth, are more myth than they are history. What makes this even more intriguing is that fact that Johnny Gruelle, either unwittingly or with the great sense of humor he was known for, initiated many of these legends, a number of which are continuously repeated as the factual history of Raggedy Ann and Andy.\n\nAccording to that site, plans for what would become an extremely popular rag doll were well underway when Marcella becae ill and died of an infection at the site of a previously administered vaccination:\n\nWhen the real-life Marcella Gruelle died, at age 13, from the ravages of an infected vaccination, her parents were, understandably devastated. Under different circumstances, this would have been a time of great rejoicing for Gruelle and his family. He was connecting with juvenile publishers, and was working on several sets of illustrated fairy stories. In November (the same month of Marcella's death) Gruelle had been granted final approval by the U.S. Patent office for his doll called \"Raggedy Ann.\" But all was overshadowed by the death of his beloved daughter.\n\nAs both doll historians stated, Marcella died not because of a vaccination, but possibly because of an infection related to the vaccination. Advances in medical sterilization and clinical protocols suggest a death like Marcella's would be highly implausible under typical circumstances more than a century later.\n\nAntibiotics and sterilization changed dramatically between the 20th and the 21st centuries.  No honest comparison could be drawn between medicine in 1915 and 2017, as illustrated by Centers for Disease Control statistics (unrelated to vaccines):\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, for every 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy-related complications, and approximately 100 infants died before age 1 year (1,2). From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births, and from 1900 through 1997, the maternal mortality rate declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births (7.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997). Environmental interventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in surveillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of living contributed to this remarkable decline. Despite these improvements in maternal and infant mortality rates, significant disparities by race and ethnicity persist. This report summarizes trends in reducing infant and maternal mortality in the United States, factors contributing to these trends, challenges in reducing infant and maternal mortality, and provides suggestions for public health action for the 21st century.\n\nBoth Doll Kind and Hall's myths about Raggedy Ann's origins were well circulated, and Marcella's death is an integral part of the doll's apocrypha. However, Johnny Gruelle filed his patent for the dolls on 28 May 1915 and received it on 7 November 1915. Marcella coincidentally passed away on 8 November 1915, one day after her father's patent was granted.\n\nGiven that Gruelle filed the patent several months before his daughter died, it is impossible that he created the dolls as a response to his daughter's death. Raggedy Ann was in the works long before Marcella received any vaccinations, became ill, or died."

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nIn May 2020, as the drug Remdesivir was being explored as a potential treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a widespread social media post posited a sprawling conspiracy involving U.S. biopharmaceutical company Gilead, China, the international medical organization Unitaid, George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Health Organization, Hillary Clinton, and National Institute of Allergy, and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci. The theory holds that together they were trying to suppress the supposedly highly effective drug Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 in favor of Remdesivir:\n\nThe disconnected statements offered in support of the conspiracy theory added up to nothing, but some of them individually had varying amounts of truth to them, which we briefly survey below.\n\nSome very preliminary research has suggested that Remdesivir , a drug originally developed to target Ebola, may show some promise as a treatment (not a \"cure\") for COVID-19.\n\nThe patent for Remdesivir is held by Gilead Sciences , a California-based biopharmaceutical company.\n\nIn January 2020, the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences applied to patent the use of Remdesivir in China. Even if that application were granted, it would have very limited scope and would not mean that China would \"own\" the patent to Remdesivir:\n\n\"Even if the Wuhan Institute’s application gets authorized, the role is very limited because Gilead still owns the fundamental patent of the drug,\" said Zhao Youbin, a Shanghai-based intellectual property counsel at Purplevine IP Service Co. “Any exploitation of the patent must seek approval from Gilead.\"\n\nUnitaid is an international organization that invests in innovations to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria more quickly, affordably and effectively. Unitaid also works to improve access to diagnostics and treatment for HIV co-infections such as hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV), and they have \"moved quickly to reshape its programs to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic .\" Unitaid is not \"Gilead's drug patent sharing subsidiary branch\" (or any other form subsidiary of Gilead), the organization told us, nor does Unitaid have an office near Wuhan, China. (Unitaid has a single office location in Geneva, Switzerland.)\n\nUnitaid's \" About Us\" website page notes that the organization \"is a hosted partnership of the World Health Organization\" (from whom they receive no financial support), and Unitaid's \" Investing in Unitaid \" page states that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a main donor. Unitaid has no past or current links, financial or otherwise, with George Soros or Fauci, the organization told us via email.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign cycle, individuals associated with Gilead donated to Hillary Clinton 's campaign (and to many other candidates from both parties). Nonetheless, during that campaign, Clinton asserted she would \"go after drug companies that charge exorbitant prices\" and singled out Gilead, \"whose hepatitis C drugs cost between $900 and $1,000 per pill in the United States.\" In response to our query, Unitaid informed us that it did not provide financial or other support to the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential election campaign.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of which Fauci is the director , to study the \"risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China.\" Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however.\n\nThe anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine, much-touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential COVID-19 treatment, does not have a proven \"92% success rate\" in treating patients with that disease. Rather, according to a \" finding from a retrospective analysis conducted by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration,\" hydroxychloroquine for treatment of patients with COVID-19, \"combined with or without azithromycin, not only may not help mitigate the virus' effect, it also may increase overall mortality.\""

      "text": "About this rating\n\nThe reusable grocery list was an authentic item invented in the 20th century. However...\n\nIt was invented in the 1950s, not the 1920s as a viral Twitter post claimed.\n\nFact Check\n\nA photograph shared widely on social media authentically shows an antique reusable grocery list from the 1950s — not the 1920s, as some online posters have claimed . One such post was so popular that it was shared by over 18,000 people and liked nearly 244,000 times.\n\nWe’d like to take credit for this debunk, but that credit is due science writer Joe Hanson , who took to a Twitter thread in August 2022 to show his process in the “fine art of baloney detection.”\n\nAs Hanson pointed out, spaghetti and frozen foods weren’t “everyday items” in the U.S. until after World War II. Though frozen peas, for example, were popularized in the 1920s, it wasn’t until the 1940s that frozen foods were largely available to consumers, noted Wiltshire Farm Foods . That’s because, in part, refrigerators weren’t widely available until Freon , the cooling agent in freezers, was more widely used in the 1940s. Of course, there’s the possibility that the list was made in another English-speaking country with a different history of foods, so we plugged the picture into a reverse image search engine , just to be sure.\n\nJust as Hanson noted in his thread, a search on TinEye revealed that the image in question had been posted on the internet at least 55 times, including to sites like Pinterest , Reddit and Imgur , since at least 2020. The photograph was also featured by the Daily Mail in April 2021, where it was referenced as a “metal-block shopping list from the 1940s.”\n\nAntique fanatics also had a few things to say on forums about when the item was likely used. Some of these posters also shared similar devices for sale on Ebay and Etsy , and also noted that the grocery list was likely from the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nHanson added that the back was “stamped ‘Patent Pending’” and decided to do a bit more digging.\n\n“That means that in whatever year this was made a patent application had already been filed in the U.S. but not granted. If we can find that app, it'll give us the earliest possible year of manufacture,” he wrote . “Luckily one of our antique detectives already tracked down the patent for us…”\n\nAnd a quick Google search for \"Benjamin Robbio patent\" returned an issue of the U.S. Patent Office official gazette that detailed the newly invented grocery list:\n\nIt was described as:\n\nA memorandum device comprising a hollow body having a top wall, indicia on the obverse face of said wall at spaced locations therealong, a one-piece supporting plate within said body having a longitudinal opening therein, a spring member secured to said plate, said spring member bridging said opening and resting on said plate at the opposite edges thereof, individual movable keys projecting through said wall, each key located to serve one of said spaced indicia and movable into at least two positions with reference to said indicia to selectively designate said indicia, a surface of each of said keys extending into engagement with said spring member at a location thereon between the edges of said opening to be tensioned and held by said spring member in one of said two selected positions.\n\nAnd like Hanson pointed out , this photograph is a classic case of recycled content whose context and background has gradually deteriorated over the dozens of times it has been reshared. So while the photograph in question features a very real product, it was patented and subsequently sold in the 1950s.\n\nOr was it?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nHat-tip to Hanson for his careful reporting and dynamic way of sharing with the internet how quickly rumors can be debunked if we spend a little bit of time doing the heavy lifting.\n\nFor the record, Rush Kazi, whose tweet went viral after reposting the photograph in August, said in a subsequent tweet that there was a picture in a “Simpsons group saying it was from the 20s.” Kazi then Googled it and found an article saying that it “could be from the 20s,\" but as we now know, it was not."

      "article_title": "FACT CHECK: Was the Revolving Door Invented by a Man Who Disliked Holding Open Doors for Women?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nSince the middle of the last century, revolving doors have been a quietly ubiquitous feature of modern cities around the world. But do they have their origins in one man's neurotic attitude toward holding doors open for women?\n\nThe most often-cited example of this legend is a 2013 article in Slate by Roman Mars, of the design podcast 99% Invisible.\n\nThe story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of “oh you first, I insist.” But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women. He set about inventing his way out of social phobia.\n\nIn the accompanying podcast episode, Mars warned: \"Keep in mind that with all these origin stories, when they sound a little too much like stories, they're probably not completely true.\"\n\nDavid McCall, writing in the Australian Design Review four years later, also traced the invention to Van Kannel's purported misogyny:\n\nThe story goes that he invented the revolving door because he simply hated holding doors open for people, especially women. It has also been reported that Kannel [sic] was a man without a family. These two facts may not be unrelated.\n\nThe earliest version of the story that we could find was a 2008 post by Jaime Morrison on the art and design blog The Nonist, which went into considerable detail about the origins of Van Kannel's aversion to chivalry, tracing it back to a public spanking from his mother and attributing his invention to his wife's insistence that he hold open doors for her at all times.\n\nIt seems that when Van Kennel [sic] was a boy, still in the care of his mother but just on the cusp of cultural manhood, he found the lingering rules of chivalry rather bothersome. In particular he refused to accept that he was expected to open the door for women and allow them to cross the threshold before him.\n\nA silly sort of quirk to our minds, certainly, but it was taken seriously enough by his mother that after numerous warnings and threats she eventually felt compelled to take action. Van Kennel [sic] family histories have it that at some point in his twelfth year she administered a savage bare-bottomed spanking, during a salon in the family’s drawing room, in full and explicit view of 37 local mothers and daughters.\n\n...Had this been the only episode the world may have never had a revolving door to shuffle through. As it so happens, however, Theophilus Van Kennel [sic] married a woman who, though beautiful and slyly clever, had an odd and stubborn quirk of her own.\n\nYoung Abigail Van Kennel, it seems, refused to pass from one room of their apartments to another without the assistance of Theophilus.\n\nThat blog post contains the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that \"...All untruths are, I assure you, my own. I’ll leave it to you to sort out which is which\"; and cites just one source, an essay by the MIT professor James Buzard -- which makes no mention of Van Kannel's now-legendary misogyny.\n\nIndeed, despite extensive archival research, we did not find any evidence to back up the persistent rumor that Theophilus Van Kannel invented and refined the revolving door because of a neurotic aversion to holding doors open for women and others. In fact, we found several pieces of evidence which severely undermine the credibility of this claim.\n\nIn July 1882, an H. Bockhacker received a patent in Berlin for a \"Thür ohne Luftzug\" (\"draftless door\") whose design is essentially that of a revolving door.\n\nEuropean Patent Office\n\nSix years later, on 7 August 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania received Patent #387,571 for his \"Storm Door Structure.\"\n\nU.S. Patents Office/Google\n\nIn his patent application, Van Kannel wrote:\n\nIt will be evident that a storm door structure of the character described possesses numerous advantages over a hinged-door structure of the usual character, for, as the door fits snugly in the casing, it is perfectly noiseless in its operation and effectually prevents the entrance of wind, snow, rain, or dust either when it is closed or when persons are passing through it. Moreover, the door cannot be blown open by the wind, as the pressure is equal on both sides of the center of motion.\n\nVan Kannel subsequently patented several refinements and improvements to the revolving door, founded the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company, and died in New York City on Christmas Eve, 1919, at the age of 78.\n\nUndated photograph of Theophilus Van Kannel.\n\nHe was born in a log cabin in Coshocton County, Ohio, on 21 October 1841, to Swiss immigrant parents. Throughout his life, he was a prolific inventor.\n\nA 1988 publication of his autobiography and journal , housed in the Library of Congress, lists 49 patents, but the book's editor writes that Van Kannel might have actually put his name to \"about 75\" of them.\n\nOver the years, Theophilus invented a cherry stoner, cider mill, water hydrant, shipping tag, gas machine check-valve, a sewing machine, an \"apparatus for scalding vegetable or fruit,\" and many more. He was also the inventor and owner of the Witching Waves ride at a Coney Island amusement park.\n\nHe married Amanda Clayton, of Chester, Illinois and in November 1867 the couple had a daughter named Lulu. This refutes David McCall's suggestion that Van Kannel's alleged misogyny was due to the fact that he did not have a family. He did. The fact that Van Kannel's wife was named Amanda also severely undermines The Nonist's colorful stories about his wife \"Abigail,\" who \"refused to pass from one room of their apartments to another.\"\n\nIn fact, Theophilus Van Kannel's two-volume, almost 500-page autobiography and journal does not contain any evidence of any neurosis relating to women, nor any social phobias of any kind. What it does reveal is a multi-talented young man, somewhat sober and straight-laced, who struggled for many years with debt and an artificial leg, but enjoyed a fairly healthy social life, combined with a consistent dedication to his work.\n\nHe wrote frequently to his mother, regularly visited his sister and her family, and spoke lovingly about his female relatives. (His journal entry on 30 January 1864 reads: \"Letter from my sister requesting me to write an obituary for her husband. Sent $5 to mother.\")\n\nAnother entry suggests Van Kannel understood and honored the Victorian norms of chivalry, without any reservations.\n\n28 September 1861 (aged 19): ...I received permission to buy some window blinds for the schoolhouse. While in the post office a very old lady came in to send off a letter, but she had no money to pay for the stamp. She asked the postmaster, Mr Bowman, to credit her, but he refused. I then bought ten cents' worth of stamps and sent her letter. She was a stranger to me...\n\nAs he grew into his 20s, Van Kannel's journal shows him courting young women in Cincinnati, Ohio, all the while following the rules of chivalry and decorum.\n\n26 February 1863 (aged 21): We all went to the church again this evening to practice our parts for the exhibition, and all showed great improvement. For the first time I mustered up enough courage to ask a young lady for her company home, and she very readily accepted.\n\n1875 photograph of Theophilus Van Kannel with his wife Amanda and daughter Lulu.\n\nNothing in his journal suggests the kind of \"social phobia\" or misogyny involved in the many stories told about him 150 years later. He attended church every Sunday, taught children, attended school with men and women, was an active member of debating societies, met friends for dinner and drinks (although he disliked drunkenness), and occasionally escorted young women home or to the theater.\n\nHis interests and inventions were eclectic. By 1867 he was already developing a type of door spring, and so it's not at all surprising that he would turn his mind to the innovation that eventually became the revolving door.\n\nSwinging doors let in drafts, making it difficult to control the temperature of a building, especially one with heavy footfall like a bank or train station. It is in keeping with the pattern of Van Kannel's professional life that he would have identified this problem, and attempted to solve it using his gift for engineering.\n\nHis invention of the revolving door does not require a psychological motivation. Nor were we able to find one, despite reading hundreds of pages of archival material and the journal of Theophilus Van Kannel himself. We looked at several news and feature articles about Van Kannel, some dating to the early 20th century. Not one mentioned Van Kannel's now-mythical misogyny or aversion to chivalry -- until The Nonist post, the veracity of which is extremely questionable.\n\nWe contacted the 99% Invisible podcast, but we did not receive a reply by publication time.\n\nIn October 2018, we received an email from Jaime Morrison, creator of the Nonist blog and author of the 2008 article about Theophilus Van Kannel and the invention of the revolving door. Morrison told us that he had written about Van Kannel's now-legendary misogyny as no more than a joke which he was disappointed to find had been taken seriously by others:\n\nI just wanted to confirm that yes, the piece was in fact a humor piece, and that yes the chivalry aspect of the story was a total fabrication...When I wrote the piece I assumed that the absurdity of the idea would be self-evident, and even hedged by including the disclaimer which [you quoted]. Alas, that old chestnut about assumptions proved its inherent wisdom yet again."

      "article_title": "Did Samsung Pay a $1 Billion Judgment to Apple in Nickels?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn August 2012, the business and technology worlds were rocked by a decision in a patent infringement lawsuit which had a jury finding that Samsung, the world's largest maker of cell phones, had copied patented features of Apple's iPhone and iPad technologies in several of its products, and awarding Apple $1.05 billion in damages.\n\nSeveral days later, that decision was spoofed in a humor piece (translated from the original Spanish) positing that Samsung had paid off the award in nickels:\n\nSamsung Pays Apple $1 Billion Sending 30 Trucks Full of 5 Cents Coins\n\nThis morning more than 30 trucks filled with 5-cent coins arrived at Apple’s headquarters in California. Initially,  the security company that protects the facility said the trucks were in the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that  they will pay $1 billion dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way.\n\nThe funny part is that the signed document does not specify a single payment method, so Samsung is entitled to send the creators of the iPhone their billion dollars in the way they deem best.\n\nMany readers who came across the article as it was circulated online mistook it for real news, even though the original and its most common reproductions were labeled as \"humor\" and \"satire.\"  But even for those who encountered it out of context, several aspects of the story should have stood out as implausible:\n\nThe jury decision awarding Apple $1.05 billion in damages had been issued only a few days earlier, and damages as large as this are not paid off nearly so quickly.  The judge in the case had not yet handed down her decision, and undoubtedly several rounds of appeals (likely culminating in a settlement), dragging on for months (if not years), would take place before Samsung actually paid out any damages to Apple, as noted in the Washington Post :\n\nQ. Was the verdict final?\n\nA. No. Samsung is challenging it. First, Samsung will first ask the trial judge to toss the verdict. Then it will appeal to a court in Washington that specializes in patent appeals. Samsung has vowed to take the fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.\n\n(Indeed, a judge later found the jury had miscalculated $400 million in damages for 13 products and ordered a new trial to determine how much Samsung should pay.)\n\nTo pay off a billion dollars in nickels would require 20 billion of those coins.  That amount would require Samsung to obtain the equivalent of all the nickels struck by the U.S. Mint in the last several decades.  (In 2011, for example, the U.S. Mint produced less than one billion nickels, and 2010 less than half a billion.)  Samsung would have to round up virtually every nickel in circulation to acquire over $1 billion worth of those coins, a feat that could hardly be accomplished without having a significant impact on the U.S. monetary system.\n\nA single nickel weights 5 grams (about .011 pounds), so a billion dollars' worth of nickels would weigh in at about 110,000 tons.  That load would far exceed the carrying capacity of 30 or so trucks (requiring each truck to carry over 3,600 tons, or more than 7.2 million lbs. each). Even if the considerable weight of the trucks themselves weren't taken into account, the equivalent of about 2,755 eighteen-wheeler trucks, each hauling 40 tons' worth of nickels, would be needed to transport the weight of that many coins (and even that calculation still doesn't take into account the volume of physical space needed to assemble, transport, and store 20 billion nickels).\n\nAs to the hypothetical question of whether Apple would be obligated to accept payment of damages in such a form, since the late 19th century pennies and nickels have been considered legal tender and are therefore \"a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor.\"   (Businesses selling goods or services are not required by law to accept legal tender as payment, but this particular scenario involves payment of a debt rather than a purchase of goods or services.)"

      "article_title": "FACT CHECK: Is Snapchat Building a Facial Recognition Database for the Feds?",
      "text": "About this rating\n\nOne of the more whimsical messaging options offered by Snapchat — a social media app for mobile devices introduced in 2011 — is the ability to personalize selfies in real time and share them instantly with other users, a feature that has at once contributed to the app's immense popularity (Snapchat boasts an estimated 166 million users daily) and raised privacy concerns among some of its customers.\n\nSnapchat's rotating toolbox of image filters, called Lenses, enables users to manipulate photos and videos to humorous effect, as seen in these examples shared publicly on Instagram by celebrity Snapchatter Chrissy Teigen:\n\nCute and innocent though it may appear, the feature has become the target of conspiracy theorists claiming that Snapchat's corporate owner, Snap Inc., uses it to collect facial recognition data which it allegedly stores and shares with law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and CIA.\n\nWe've found examples of such rumors dating back to Fall 2015 (soon after the Lenses feature was officially rolled out):\n\nyou guys are all swooning over the snapchat filters... And The FBI is getting the most extensive facial recognition library ever\n\n— TEENWOLF (@TEENWOLFREMIX) October 3, 2015\n\nIt wasn't until April of the following year that the rumors reached takeoff speed, however, thanks largely to a tweet composed by hip hop artist, songwriter, and unabashed flat-earth theorist B.o.B to his roughly two million followers:\n\nwhen you realize all the snap chat filters are really building a facial recognition database ☕️?\n\n— B.o.B (@bobatl) April 16, 2016\n\nIn May 2016, with civil cases already pending against Facebook and Google alleging unauthorized use of facial recognition technology, a class action lawsuit was filed by two Snapchat users in Illinois complaining that the app violated their rights under the state's Biometric Information Privacy Act ( BIPA ) by failing to obtain adequate permission before gathering and storing their \"biometric identifiers and biometric information\".\n\nThe company flatly denied it:\n\nContrary to the claims of this frivolous lawsuit, we are very careful not to collect, store, or obtain any biometric information or identifiers about our community.\n\nThe class action suit was eventually dismissed in favor of arbitration in September 2016, but as of this writing the case remains unresolved. Crucial to Snapchat's defense is their position, as stated in the Privacy Center of the company's web site, that the app relies on object recognition, not facial recognition, to make Lenses work:\n\nHave you ever wondered how Lenses make your eyes well up with tears or rainbows come out your mouth? Some of the magic behind Lenses is object recognition. Object recognition is an algorithm designed to understand the general nature of things that appear in an image. It lets us know that a nose is a nose or an eye is an eye. But object recognition isn’t the same as facial recognition. While Lenses can recognize faces in general, they can't recognize a specific face.\n\nIf it's true that Lenses can't recognize (i.e., identify) specific faces, then the claim that the app produces anything qualifying as a \"biometric identifier\" under Illinois law is seriously in doubt. (The district judge in Illinois overseeing the Google facial recognition case previously defined \"biometric identifier\" as \"a set of biology-based measurements ... used to identify a person.”)\n\nAs to the wider claim that Snapchat is building a \"facial recognition database,\" the distinction between object and facial recognition, at minimum, places a burden of proof on those trumpeting the claim to show that the app is capable of identifying specific faces in the first place. If this explanation (provided by the web site Vox) of how the software works is accurate, Snapchat doesn't need to be able to identify specific faces to accomplish the task. It has to recognize a face as a face, and identify the parts of a face as the nose, eyes, ears, chin, etc., but it doesn't have to recognize who the face belongs to:\n\nMoreover, Snapchat's Privacy Policy states that the company neither collects nor permanently stores user-created content (meaning photos and videos) let alone preserves such items in a database:\n\nSnapchat lets you capture what it’s like to live in the moment. On our end, that means that we automatically delete the content of your Snaps (the photo and video messages that you send your friends) from our servers after we detect that a Snap has been opened by all recipients or has expired.\n\nAnd although the policy further acknowledges that Snap Inc. may share users' personal information \"to comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation\" (and transparency reports show that the company has indeed complied with such requests in the past), they can't grant the FBI (or any other agency) access to a \"facial recognition database\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSome rumors die hard, however. An updated variant that cropped up in early 2017 brought two new claims to the mix: one, that the FBI literally created Snapchat's image filtering software (and alleged facial recognition database); and two, that there is a smoking gun to prove it — namely U.S. patent #9396354:\n\nAccording to an analysis by Sophos' Naked Security blogger Alison Booth, the patent proposes using facial recognition software to identify individual subjects in photos, whereupon the latter would be modified and/or their distribution restricted in accordance with the subjects' pre-established privacy settings.\n\nThere is a catch. Implementation of the process would, of course, require amassing a facial recognition database. \"For facial recognition to work,\" writes Booth, \"Snapchat would need to store images of all users that sign up to the feature — as a reference image to compare photos against.\"\n\nSo, there it is — a \"facial recognition database\" of the sort conspiracy theorists have been going on about since 2015, except that Snapchat has not, to date, implemented such a feature (a fact we were able to confirm with the company), nor is there evidence that the FBI (or any other law enforcement agency) was involved in creating it, nor does the patent itself mention sharing facial recognition data with government entities.\n\nDespite finding no legitimate basis for the claim that Snapchat is currently engaged in collecting, storing, or sharing facial recognition data on its users, we do not wish to downplay the increasing prevalence of facial recognition technology in both commercial and government applications, nor the privacy issues this raises.\n\nSen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) articulated some of these issues in a statement announcing the release of a 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the privacy implications of the technology:\n\nThe newly released report raises serious concerns about how companies are collecting, using, and storing our most sensitive personal information. I believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, which is why it's important that, at the very least, the tech industry adopts strong, industry-wide standards for facial recognition technology. But what we really need are federal standards that address facial recognition privacy by enhancing our consumer privacy framework.\n\nThe tech industry has yet to address these concerns to the satisfaction of consumer privacy watchdogs , however, nor has Congress made progress toward establishing the federal standards Franken called for. Thus far, issue has been dealt with primarily in the court system via cases such as the aforementioned BIPA class action lawsuits against Facebook and Google.\n\nOne of the ironies of the false alarms about Snapchat's alleged sharing of facial recognition data with the FBI is that the agency already maintains a biometric data network comprising the facial images of more than 117 million Americans (about half the U.S. adult population, and growing), mostly drawn from state DMV databases and other non-criminal sources. A 2016 report by the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology warned that the technology is both error-prone, with a disproportionate impact on communities of color, and almost totally unregulated.\n\nIn testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing chaired by Sen. Franken in 2012, Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Jennifer Lynch urged Congress to act sooner rather than later to protect the biometric privacy of all Americans:\n\nFace recognition and its accompanying privacy concerns are not going away. Given this, it is imperative that government act now to limit unnecessary biometrics collection; instill proper protections on data collection, transfer, and search; ensure accountability; mandate independent oversight; require appropriate legal process before government collection; and define clear rules for data sharing at all levels. This is important to preserve the democratic and constitutional values that are bedrock to American society."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nYelling \"McDonalds!\" to end a television commercial for the fast-food restaurant is just one example of many \"interactive commercials\" contained within this patent.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2023, a Twitter user tweeted that \"Sony owns a patent that would force viewers to exclaim the brand name during commercials [in order] to end them.\" The tweet, which went viral, was accompanied by a \" meme-worthy \" patent illustration:\n\nSnopes readers asked us if this was a genuine patent truly owned by Sony and if its purpose is accurately described in the viral tweet. In short, the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nMore broadly, the patent — tracked down by TechRadar editor Lance Ulanoff — describes a \"system for converting television commercials into interactive networked video games.\" The verbal commercial-ender is just one of several advertising solutions outlined in the patent. The patent is, indeed, owned by Sony.\n\nThe viral image comes from Figure 9 in this patent. The interpretation of the comic matches the technical notes for this figure:\n\nIn [the] first capture of the sequence, a user is watching [a] movie. Progress pointer in progress bar shows that [the] content display corresponds to a movie and that [a] break is approaching.\n\nOn second capture, progress pointer shows that the movie has progressed to break for placing the IC [Interactive Commercial]. IC is interactive and instructions from the display ask the user to 'Say \"McDonalds\" to end [the] commercial.'\n\nOn third capture, the user is saying \"McDonalds!\" The client device includes a microphone that captures the user's words and voice recognition on the device [that] determines that the user has responded.\n\nThe system then proceeds to skip the rest of the commercial, as shown on fourth capture, where the user goes back to watch the movie.\n\nWhat's the point? The patent provides one example of a motivation for both advertiser and viewer:\n\nIn one embodiment, the user gets rewarded with some points or a coupon from the sponsor [for shouting out the brand]. The rewards can be collected by the user in a variety of ways, such as receiving a coupon in the mail or via email, getting a text message in a mobile phone with the coupon, collecting points toward collecting [prizes] in a web site, etc.\n\nThis, it bears highlighting, is not the only McDonald's-based interactive commercial technology described in the Sony patent. Figure 8 describes a scenario in which a viewer could \"speed up\" a commercial by \"throwing a pickle\" into a burger:\n\nIn the embodiment of FIG. 8, the instructions are \"Throw the pickle to speed up commercial.\" The user, which is holding a one-handed controller with motion detection, swings his arm to simulate the act of throwing a pickle. As a result, the flying interactive pickle is placed in the burger, and the commercial message \"Make it your way\" is displayed briefly before the commercial ends and the user returns to watching the streaming media.\n\nBecause this is a genuine patent owned by Sony that describes a system for skipping commercials that involves yelling brand names out loud, the claim is \"True.\""

Among the grant recipients was Harvard physicist Anita Goel’s private research company Nanobiosym, which has developed a mobile pathogen-detection tool that has the potential to detect genetic mutations to bacterial infections in real time.\n\nThis “ tricorder ”-style device, dubbed Gene-RADAR by Nanobiosym, is described as follows in a patent filing :\n\nA portable system for extracting, optionally amplifying, and detecting nucleic acids or proteins using a compact integrated chip in combination with a mobile device system for analyzing detected signals.\n\nWith the receipt of the CASIS grant, Nanobiosym was given the opportunity to refine the technology in space. Not only will this help with the development that technology, but it may also allow scientists to view genetic mutations to bacterial in “ fast-forward ”, helping scientists predict the ways in which bacterial infections develop antibiotic resistance, as described in the NASA mission summary :\n\nMicrogravity may accelerate the rate of bacterial mutations and this pilot investigation analyzes this process in two strains aboard the International Space Station, which may provide insight into how deadly bacteria become drug-resistant. The data can help refine models of drug resistance and support development of better medicines to counter it.\n\nThis conclusion is far from settled science, as described in a 2015 review paper , but both space-based and low-gravity simulation experiments have demonstrated that it is at least plausible that low gravity affects the mutation rate of some bacterial species:\n\nThere is general agreement that microgravity represents the major influence on bacterial growth kinetics and bacterial cell behavior during short orbital flights, although radiation may increase microbial mutation rates during flight [as well].\n\nIf, as Goel hypothesizes, mutations rates speed up in space, Scientists may be able to use this information to develop drugs that anticipate potential mechanisms of antibiotic resistance before they occur, as described in a CASIS press release :\n\nThe project will attempt to computationally predict bacterial mutations, to evaluate model organisms in space, and to use the empirical results to validate and refine the company’s predictive algorithms. This proof-of-concept experiment will provide data that can be applied to future predictive models for antibiotic resistant pathogen mutations, which will be of significant value to antibiotic drug development.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem that gained increased media attention with the death of a patient from a bacterial infection resistant to 26 different antibiotic medications in August 2016."

At least, that's according to a 2023 post ( archive ) on Reddit that described the invention of the popular drinking vessel.\n\nThe above claim was later popularized in a Jan. 19, 2024, opinion post published by Cosmopolitan ( archive ) discussing Stanley cups and the \"endless chase for the influencer aesthetic.\" In the piece, author Daisy Maldonado wrote: \"What started as a cup meant for *checks notes* blue-collar workers and WWII pilots (seriously!) is now an obsession for millennial moms and sorority sisters.\" This quote was later shared on Instagram on Feb. 24, 2024 ( archive ):\n\nA post shared by Cosmopolitan (@cosmopolitan)\n\nThe story posted amid the craze whereby the \"thermos for tough guys\" had become the \" TikTok obsession of millennials , \" with people camping out to buy the hottest color .\n\nThe original Stanely Cup patent was filed by inventor William Stanley in 1912, two years before the First World War and decades before World War II. There was no mention of pilots or war in the original 1912 Stanley patent. World War I began in 1914 and World War II started in 1939 – years after the patent was filed.\n\nWe have therefore rated this claim as \"False.\"\n\nSnopes found the original patent filed on Aug. 5, 1912, and issued on Sept. 9, 1913, which described \"certain new and useful improvements in heat-insulated receptacle.\" Nowhere in the patent language were mentions of \"pilot\" or \"war.\" (Note that Snopes corrected some spelling errors below that resulted from formatting issues.)\n\nMy invention relates to heat insulating barriers and more particularly to the insulation of receptacles having an inner shell surrounded by an outer shell with a vacuous space there between and commonly known as vacuum bottles etc. My invention, however, may be applied to milk cans and many other devices and arrangements.\n\nThe common vacuum receptacle has its shells or walls constructed of glass and accordingly, such receptacles are likely liable to breakage and cannot withstand hard usage. Moreover, it is found that a very high degree of exhaustion must be maintained in the vacuous space to get sufficient heat insulation to make devices practicable for ordinary uses. Furthermore, because such receptacles are made of glass they are limited in size.\n\nAll of this said, it's been reported that World War II servicemen, primarily pilots, did indeed use the bottles and products. According to a blog ( archive ) published on the Stanley website:\n\nIt was 1913 when William Stanley invented the all-steel, double-wall vacuum bottle and stuck his name on it. Rumor has it, that he wanted his coffee hot all day while he was working, and was inspired to apply some of his theories learned while developing transformers. As it turns out, necessity really is the mother of invention …\n\nToday, Stanley's Built For Life™ promise means that your grandad's thermos that supported pilots in World War II could very well get set beside that brand spankin' new Classic Vacuum Insulated Bottle you picked up for your weekend camping trip.\n\nSnopes has also looked into whether Stanley tumblers contain an unsafe amount of lead ."

Do you know that barely 100 people have died in the whole world in all that time? Do you know that it was the Americans who alerted us to the efficacy of the human antiviral TAMIFLU as a preventative? Do you know that TAMIFLU barely alleviates some symptoms of the common flu? Do you know that its efficacy against the common flu is questioned by a great part of the scientific community? Do you know that against a SUPPOSED mutant virus such as H5N1, TAMIFLU barely alleviates the illness? Do you know that to date Avian Flu affects  birds only? Do you know who markets TAMIFLU? ROCHE LABORATORIES. Do you know who bought the patent for TAMIFLU from ROCHE LABORATORIES in 1996? GILEAD SCIENCES INC. Do you know who was the then president of GILEAD SCIENCES INC. and remains a major shareholder? DONALD RUMSFELD, the present Secretary of Defence of the USA. Do you know that the base of TAMIFLU is crushed aniseed? Do you know who controls 90% of the world's production of this tree? ROCHE.

Do you  know how many more millions ROCHE can earn in the coming months if the business of fear continues?\n\nSo the summary of the story is as follows: Bush's friends decide that the medicine TAMIFLU is the solution for a pandemic that has not yet occurred and that has caused a hundred deaths worldwide in 9 years. This medicine doesn't so much as cure the common flu. In normal conditions the virus does not affect humans. Rumsfeld sells the patent for TAMIFLU to ROCHE for which they pay him a fortune. Roche acquires 90% of the global production of crushed aniseed, the base for the antivirus. The governments of the entire world threaten a pandemic and then buy industrial quantities of the product from Roche. So we end up paying for medicine while Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush do the business.\n\nARE WE CRAZY!!? OR ARE WE IDIOTS!!? AT LEAST PASS THIS ON SO THAT IT CAN BE KNOWN!!!!!!!"

A small description of the product, placed on a label in front of it, read: \"POND'S TAMPONS Contain Opium, Belladonna and Hyoscyamus.\"\n\nThe caption on the Reddit post read: \"In the early 1900s, some tampons were soaked in opium and belladonna to help combat menstrual pain\":\n\nThe photograph shows an exhibit at the New Orleans Pharmacy Museum, which has formed the basis of numerous social media posts in recent years, which typically focus on the apparent addition of opium to tampons in the early 20th century, for the purpose of relieving menstrual pain:\n\nA higher resolution photograph of the exhibit, captured in 2020 , more clearly shows that the packaging lists \"Opium, Belladonna and Hyoscyamus\" as ingredients:\n\nIt also provides clues as to the exact nature of these tampons, stating:\n\nPatented in the United States, Aug. 12th, 1902; Jan. 12th 1904; Feb. 13th 1906.\n\nFrom those details, we know that the product exhibited at the museum, and shown in various social media posts, was the one patented in the United States in 1902, by Edmund Morse Pond — a Rutland, Vermont surgeon and inventor. (The 1904 and 1906 patents were for improvements to the original.)\n\nThat 1902 patent described a \"medicated tampon,\" and stated:\n\nMy invention has relation to improvements in surgical appliances in the nature of suppositories, tampons and capsules for internal application and treatment of the uterine system or of the rectum; and the object is to provide a compressible and expansible roll or cylinder composed of an absorbent material which in its compressed form may be applied within a cavity of the body and when so applied may be released from compression and automatically expand...\n\nThe interior of the body may be cored out...to afford room for a medical substance, which will saturate the material and eventually reach the surface and be applied to the diseased member. In the other instances the material composing the device may be saturated before or after compression, or the gelatinous covering may constitute the medicated medium.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 20th century, Pond also obtained patents for medicated tampons in the United Kingdom , France , and Switzerland .\n\nPond's \"medicated tampon\" highlights an important distinction. In 2022, a tampon is near universally understood as a product designed to absorb blood and secretions during menstruation. In the 19th and early-20th centuries, that wasn't always the case.\n\nThe word \"tampon\" originally derives from earlier French words for plug and cloth. In this broader sense, it had been used for centuries to describe a cloth stopper for insertion in various bodily cavities, the vagina in particular.\n\nMedical references to tampons, in English, can be found as far back as the early-19th century , and towards the end of the 1800s, U.S. patents were granted for several products that mentioned the word \"tampon,\" but did not match the device's modern functions.\n\nRather, the tampon was typically intended for use by medical professionals (rather than non-professional female consumers) and designed to help deliver or apply some substance or other (rather than for absorbing menses), and in the treatment of a specific perceived malady (rather than as a straightforward remedy for menstrual cramping).\n\nHence this 1907 advertisement , which promoted Pond's tampons as \"a perfect method of local medication in gynecological work\" and \"as a means of applying local treatment in gonorrhea, endometritis, cervicitis,\" and so on:\n\nSimilarly, a 1922 advertisement promoted Pond's tampons to \"progressive gynecologists and physicians in general\" as \"an easy, safe and thorough method of vaginal and uterine medication.\"\n\nIn the late-19th and early-20th centuries, doctors undoubtedly overprescribed opium for a variety of complaints, and there is some evidence that included menstrual pain, or \"dysmenorrhea,\" and that in some cases, the opium was administered via a tampon . Doctors also sometimes performed opium enemas on women experiencing various gynecological ailments.\n\nIt certainly wasn't unheard of, therefore, for menstrual cramping to occasionally be treated with an opium-soaked tampon, but readers should approach with caution the picture presented in some social media posts — that countless independently minded, turn-of-the-century women unapologetically and routinely vanquished their own menstrual pain using the weapon of an opium-soaked tampon.\n\nThe printed historical record — consisting of newspaper articles and advertisements, medical journals, and so on — contains only a handful of references to the use of opium with Pond's tampons, and of those, none was for the stated purpose of relieving straightforward cramping.\n\nMore broadly, the printed record contains plenty of references to the combined use of tampons and opium, but the majority of those instances have to do with the management of pain and hemorrhaging in the context of pregnancy, miscarriages, and abortions, and therefore most certainly not in the context of menstruation."

However, this application was abandoned in 2013, due to a \"Failure to Respond to an Office Action,\" which means he does not presently hold an active patent for this technology.\n\nAccording to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Howard's 2010 patent application was for a \" System and method for merging virtual reality and reality to provide an enhanced sensory experience.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Rogan read Howard's patent abstract out loud for the audience:\n\n\"A system and method of merging virtual reality sensory detail from a remote site into a room environment at a local site. The system preferably includes at least one image server; a plurality of image collection devices; a display system, comprising display devices, a control unit, digital processor and a viewer position detector.

The digital processor preferably processes source data representing an aggregated field of view from the image capturing devices in accordance with the instructions received from the control unit and outputs refined data representing a desired display view to be displayed on the one or more display devices wherein the viewer position detector dynamically determines the position of the viewer in the room environment and changes the desired display view corresponding to position changes of the viewer.\"\n\nHoward, who further claimed he's filed 97 patents for various inventions including jewelry and children's toys, told Rogan that \"the universe backs me up and I have the proof of it,\" suggesting that many physicists do not have his pedigree when it comes to holding exclusive rights to an invention. \"None of them have introduced a new form of flight with unlimited midair bonding. None of them have discovered four super symmetrical systems. This is what we've done. This is what the collective is able to do.

The patent application notes it has been cited 31 times in patents filed by such companies as Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon and IBM. But while these companies may indeed have referenced Howard's patent application in building their own AR/VR technology, it's unclear whether they also used any of his proprietary prototypes, specs or technology.

When you file for a patent — say, with the USPTO — it's a formal submission to a government authority seeking exclusive territorial rights to an invention.\n\nBut the act of filing, in which the filer provides a detailed description and claims, doesn't mean the applicant automatically get those rights. Over the course of several years, a patent examiner audits an application to see if the invention meets certain rules, evaluating for novelty, non-obviousness and usefulness, conducting searches for prior art and technology, assessing claims made in the applications, and communicating findings . If the invention passes this evaluation by a patent examiner, the applicant is granted a patent. Being a patent holder means one has legal protection against unauthorized making, using, selling or importing of the invention, and that one legally owns exclusive rights to the invention for a certain time, usually 20 years, within a particular country or region. So, while filing is an important step, it's receiving the patent grant that confers those rights.\n\nSo, Howard's patent application number, US12/765,485, was assigned when he filed his patent application on April 22, 2010, serving as a tracking identifier during the examination process before ultimate approval or rejection of his patent. He also received a publication number, US20100271394A1, on Oct. 28, 2010, which is another step in the patent process. However, he never received a unique patent number signifying the patent was granted, because he abandoned the patent in 2013, which he claimed was due to financial concerns, before it could be granted.\n\n\"This patent has earned over $7 trillion. And I haven't gotten a penny,\" Howard told Rogan. \"Now there's eight years in which I would be making money off it but what they didn't know is they didn't understand how it was really supposed to work. So, they've just been taking this gun and been using it as a bat. And if they wanted to know I could show them how it really, really works but this is proof that my stuff is legit.\"\n\nSnopes has previously written about patents, including Ford Global Technologies' patent application for a self-drive vehicle that can repossess itself , and Sony's patent for an interactive system that allows viewers to skip advertisements by yelling the brand name of the advertiser at their TV or monitor."

      "text": "In March 2015, The Next Web contributor Owen Williams stated on Twitter that he had discovered the definitive answer to an age-old debate over the proper orientation for hanging toilet paper on dispensers. The controversy (which boasts its own entry on Wikipedia ) has long been weighted towards the “over” (rather than the “under”) side of the debate , but Williams provided additional data to support the former position:\n\nThe patent for toilet paper should settle the over vs under debate pic.twitter.com/arZl6l6ALn\n\n— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) March 17, 2015\n\nThe image to which Williams referred was a patent filed in June of 1891 and published in September of that year by a man named Seth Wheeler for a then-innovative update to toilet paper: My invention consists of a roll of paper for wrapping or toilet use so constructed that the points of attachment and severance between the sheets will be alternately out of parallel lines running through the whole body of the sheets, so that a pull upon the free end of the web will not be transmitted in a direct line through a series of sheets,but will be diverted by the spaces opposite the connecting points of the sheet pulled upon, thereby producing a transverse strain upon the next line of connecting points sufficient to break them.\n\nIn carrying out my invention the sheets of paper are only partially separated, having their points of attachment arranged in a novel manner, whereby each sheet will easily separate from the series as it is drawn from the roll, there being no litter occasioned, and any waste of paper is thereby prevented.\n\nThe discovery of the toilet paper patent was predictably divisive: while some social media users felt that the image evidenced their favored method of toilet paper orientation, others observed that homes with cats or small children nonetheless had good reason to hang toilet paper in the “under” style.\n\nMany pundits also noted that the image and its corresponding patent lacked a crucial bit of information: it bore no indication of where the mounting area lay in relation to the roll.\n\nSome might argue that the although the toilet paper roll was deliberately depicted in a clearly outward-facing manner, that presentation was necessary to fully illustrate the functionality Wheeler sought to patent. In that respect the image merely represented the least obstructed view of the perforations involved, not a definitive answer as to whether Wheeler favored either toilet paper orientation as the “correct” one."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nThomas Crapper is an elusive figure: Most people familiar with his name know him as a celebrated figure in Victorian England, an ingenious plumber who invented the modern flush toilet; others believe him to be nothing more than a hoax, the whimsical creation of a satirical writer.  The truth lies somewhere in between.\n\nMuch of the confusion stems from a 1969 book by Wallace Reyburn, Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper . Reyburn's \"biography\" of Crapper has often been dismissed as a complete fabrication, as some of his other works (most notably Bust-Up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra ) are obvious satirical fiction.  Although Flushed with Pride is, like Bust-Up , a tongue-in-cheek work full of puns, jokes, and exaggerations, Reyburn did not invent the person of Thomas Crapper (as he did with putative brassiere-maker Otto Titzling).\n\nIn Flushed with Pride , Reyburn's satire rests on the framework of a real man's life. Thomas Crapper was not, as Reyburn wrote, the inventor of the flush toilet, a master plumber by appointment to the royals who was knighted by Queen Victoria, or an important figure whose achievements were written up in the Encyclopedia Britannica , and one searches in vain for evidence that authorities of the time took any notice of Thomas Crapper, for mention of him in biographical dictionaries, or for his obituary notice in the London Times .  But although Thomas Crapper may not have been a man of importance to his contemporaries, he was indeed a real person, a sanitary engineer in 19th century London who ran his own plumbing concern, who owned several patents on plumbing-related devices, and whose name can still be spotted on manhole covers around London.\n\nThomas Crapper took out nine plumbing patents between 1881 and 1896, but none of these patents was for the \"valveless water-waste preventer\" he is often credited with having invented (although he did manufacture and sell such devices).  The first patent for a siphonic flush was taken out by Joseph Adamson in 1853, eight years before Crapper started his plumbing business.  Many types of siphonic systems were patented in the 1880s, but none by a Crapper until George Crapper, Thomas' nephew, was awarded an 1897 patent for \"improvements in or relating to automatic syphon flushing tanks.\"  Thomas Crapper may have sold and installed water closets, but he didn't have much to do with their development.\n\nAlexander Cummings is generally credited with inventing (or, at least, patenting) the first flush mechanism in 1775 (more than 50 years before Crapper was born), and plumbers Joseph Bramah and Thomas Twyford further developed the technology with improvements such as the float-and-valve system.  Thomas Crapper, said an article in Plumbing and Mechanical Magazine , \"should best be remembered as a merchant of plumbing products, a terrific salesman and advertising genius.\"\n\nA related legend has it that U.S. soldiers stationed in England during World War I (some of whom had little or no experience with indoor plumbing) saw toilets marked with the name 'CRAPPER' and brought the word home as a synonym for 'toilet' or 'bathroom.'  Although the word 'crap' (used in a scatological sense) antedates Thomas Crapper and is therefore not derived from his name, the origins of 'crapper' as a synonym for 'toilet' are unknown, other than that it is a particularly American term whose earliest print citings come from the 1930s."

      "text": "About this rating\n\nFighting blemishes, aging, and all kinds of skin care battles is a tale almost as old as time itself, with a multitude of alleged cures, solutions, and tricks to make one's face look better in any way possible. One particular beauty hack from the late 19th century, known as a \"toilet mask\" or \"face glove,\" can probably best be described as an early version of what we know as a skin care facial mask.\n\nWe encountered a number of advertisements in American newspapers from that time period that showcased \"Madame Rowley's\" brainchild, a toilet mask which was intended for \"bleaching and preserving the skin, and removing complexion imperfections.\"\n\n(Bettmann/Getty Images)\n\nThis was indeed a real creation from the late 19th century, which was promoted in American newspapers for a number of years. In 1875, Helen M. Rowley received a patent for what she described as \"masks for medical purposes.\" According to her patent, filed in 1874:\n\nMy invention consists in the application, as a medical agent, to the face of a person suffering with certain forms of disease, or afflicted with a bad complexion, of a mask made of flexible india'rubber, either for the purpose of exciting perspiration with a view to soften and clarify the skin by relieving the pores and the superficial circulation, or for the purpose of applying and confining [u]nguents or other medical preparations to the skin of the face for the palliation or cure of cutaneous eruptions, blotches, pimples, or other similar complexional defects.\n\nMy invention is peculiarly adapted to the needs of ladies who desire to improve their complexion and I contemplate its being worn during the hours of sleep.\n\nFor freckles or fugitive discolorations, and for clogged pores and capillary congestion, the perspiration excited by covering the face with a medium which prevents the escape by evaporation of the cutaneous transpiration, acts as a bleaching agent, and to relieve the loaded pores and congested capillary vessels. But for affections requiring specific remedies the medical agent adapted to the particular ailment may be applied in the shape of an ointment or plastic preparation spread [upon] the interior surface of the mask. The mask should be made so flexible as to apply itself readily and closely to the face of the wearer.\n\nWhile Rowley herself was from Ohio, her company known as \"The Toilet Mask Company\" had offices in New York City, and even in the United Kingdom, according to one advertisement we stumbled upon in Truth magazine. This same address was present in an 1895 ad on Alamy , which referred to her as \"Madame P. Rowley.\"\n\n(Truth/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)\n\nThrough the late 19th century, her advertisements were found in regional newspapers and magazines like Harper's Bazaar :\n\n(The Philadelphia Times, 1890)\n\n(Detroit Free Press, 1889)\n\nThe ads recommend that the mask be worn during sleep, but it may be applied \"with equally good results\" at any other time.\n\nWe even found a job posting for a position with Rowley's company in 1879, asking for a \"beautiful\" and \"accomplished\" sales lady and correspondent.\n\n(New York Daily Herald (1879))\n\nGiven that we have found archival evidence of the same company operating in New York City and London, under the name of the Toilet Mask Company, as well as evidence of it being patented in 1875, we rate this claim as \"True.\""

      "text": "About this rating\n\nOn March 25, 2020, Twitter user Sage Boggs posted a thread that seemingly revealed a shocking (literally) fact: The Triscuit got its name in the early 1900s because it was one of the first foods to be baked with elec tric ity.\n\nThe entire thread is worth a read (you can view it here ). We've included screenshots of the most relevant tweets below:\n\nFactually speaking, we didn't find much to quibble with in Boggs' thread.\n\nTriscuit crackers were developed in the early 1900s, and early advertisements did tout the \"wheat biscuits\" as being \"baked by electricity.\" For example, this ad was published in The Montgomery Advertiser in September 1903:\n\nAt first, however, we weren't entirely convinced that this electric baking method served as the inspiration for the Triscuit name. In fact, Boggs' thread left us with more questions than answers. Wouldn't the letters \"ele\" better signify this product's relationship to electricity? Why not \"Elescuits\"? And aren't Triscuit snacks marketed today as crackers, not biscuits? Why not \"Tricker\"? Does \"tri\" really not refer to \"three\"? Not thrice-baked, not three ingredients, not three of anything?\n\nAnd what exactly does \"baked by electricity\" mean? In short, we just don't trust these crackers.\n\nWe went digging in the archives to learn more about the origins of Triscuit. Our working theory was based on the etymology of the word \"biscuit,\" which was derived from the medieval Latin word \"biscoctum,\" meaning \"twice-baked.\" The quiz show Jeopardy used this logic for a clue during a 2018 episode, positing: \"The name of this cracker that’s been around since 1903 suggests that it was baked 3 times.\"\n\nHowever, we were unable to find any advertisements or company materials describing the Triscuit as a thrice-baked cracker.\n\nIn fact, what we did find about the Triscuit cooking process supported the idea that it was truly an electric biscuit. The story of the Triscuit starts in the late 1800s when a man named Henry D. Perky developed a machine to produce little square biscuits made of shredded wheat. (You can see one of Perky's early patents from 1900 here ).\n\nPerky's inventions not only produced a tasty treat, they were also a major development in food manufacturing. A 1904 article in Western Electrician described how Triscuit crackers were baked, and praised the Natural Food Company for making \"the largest development of electric cooking in the world\" that had been \"successful in every way.\"\n\nWestern Electrician wrote :\n\nIn the winter of 1902-3, about a year and a half ago, the Natural Food Company of Niagara Falls, N.Y., began the manufacture of a new product they call Triscuit, it being a cracker of shredded wheat baked or toasted by having heat applied to both sides at the same time. The operation consists of passing the product through a machine between two endless link belts enclosed except at one end. The links of the belts are electric stoves, and are so arranged that the Triscuit is fed in and held pressed between the faces of the two stoves throughout the complete circuit of the machine. The operation is continuous. Each machine has about 2,500 stoves and has a product of 17,500 triscuits an hour. They are operating about 10,000 of these stoves, and their failures up to date have been less than one per cent from all causes. This is the largest development of electric cooking in the world, and is successful in every way; the cost for baking, including labor, being less for the same amount of product of triscuits than for shredded whit biscuit using coal.\n\nWhen we first came across the \"electric biscuit\" advertisement in Boggs' thread above, it seemed to be more of a clever advertising gimmick then a core aspect of a Triscuit. However, as noted in the article in Western Electrician, the electric baking process of a Triscuit was a major development in the food production world.\n\nA cookbook of shredded wheat recipes presented by the Shredded Wheat Company in 1911 also noted that the Triscuit cooking process had \"attracted the attention of electricians from all over the world\":\n\nMaking Triscuit, the Shredded Wheat Wafer: The process of making Triscuit, the shredded wheat wafer, is even more wonderful. Triscuit is Shredded Whole Wheat compressed into a cracker or wafer, and cooked by electricity in a specially-devised machine, so interesting and wonderful in its operations that it has attracted the attention of electricians from all over the world. It consists of a series of moving \"waffle-irons\" which serve to compress and indent the wafer while the electric current supplied to each \"Waffle-iron\" cooks it.\n\nThe following advertisement from a 1903 issue of American Motherhood called the Triscuit \"the highest achievement known to the science of food production.\"\n\nAnother pair of early advertisements from 1903 emphasized the \"electric\" aspect of this shredded wheat snack:\n\nWhile we were busy combing through information from the 1900s, the answer to this pressing question popped up in a more modern medium: The official Twitter account for Triscuit caught wind of Boggs' thread and updated the company's profile to include lightning bolts and the text: \"elecTRIcity biSCUIT... but you can just call us Triscuit #ifykyk.\" (If you know, you know.)\n\nTriscuit also posted a message in response to Bogg's thread, reading: \" We had to go all the way up the ladder but we CAN confirm.\"\n\nThere you have it. Triscuit crackers were named not because they contain three ingredients, or comprise three layers, or because they were baked three times, but because they were baked by electricity.\n\nOur search into the origins of the Triscuit came with quite a few surprises, but the most shocking (pun intended) to us cracker-eaters was how Triscuit was advertised as something of miracle food. It was good for children, made purely of \"God's creation\" (wheat), and could be eaten at any time of day, according to promotional materials. We also found several cookbooks featuring Triscuit recipes, and while many sounded appealing, such as Triscuit with cheese, butter, or jam, we must direct your attention to the \"King's Menu\" from volume 16 of the 1903 book The King and His Navy and Army .\n\nThe King's Menu included three Triscuit dishes: Triscuit Croutons, Cream Fruit Triscuit, and Pigeons on Triscuit Toast:"

      "text": "About this rating\n\nIn November 2012, a full election cycle before he became president, Donald Trump signed an application to trademark his now-ubiquitous campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThat move came under scrutiny in 2018 as Trump, now president, defended himself against allegations that a Russian influence campaign helped him get elected in 2016.\n\nTrademark registration documents (below) show that the slogan was proposed as a political trademark in 2012. The timing is notable, some argue, because Trump declared (on Twitter , as is his wont) that Special Counselor Robert Mueller's indictment of thirteen Russians and three companies for their role in the election cleared Trump of wrongdoing because those efforts began in 2014 (before he began his campaign):\n\nFunny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\nSome pointed out that Trump had already registered his campaign slogan in 2012 — less than a week after the 6 November 2012 re-election of President Barack Obama. The United States Patent and Trademark Office publicly details the evolution of that application (serial number 85783371), which Donald Trump signed on 12 November 2012 and his lawyers filed just a week later:\n\nThe initial application, which registered the trademark for use in \"political action committee services, namely, promoting public awareness of political issues and fundraising in the field of politics,\" did not explicitly state that the slogan would be used for a presidential run. Donald Trump later transferred the registration to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.\n\nThe application became publicly available October 2013, when it was first published for public review —all trademark applications undergo both internal and public review. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office approved the trademark's registration on 14 July 2015.\n\nTrump has flirted with a political career a number of times prior to his 2016 run. He tossed the idea around in 1987 , and again when he ran for the Reform Party nomination in 2000 . He publicly toyed with the idea of running for the 2012 GOP nomination before officially deciding against it in May 2011 . Michael Cohen, a Trump Organization executive and a current personal attorney to Donald Trump, registered the website shouldtrumprun.com even earlier, sometime in 2010 .\n\nIn 2011, after Trump decided against the 2012 race, Cohen converted the website into a 527 tax-exempt political fundraising group with an expressly stated goal: \"to convince Trump to go to Washington.\""

      "text": "About this rating\n\nWhile the photograph was real, Snopes was unable to determine whether the cone-shaped mask was a one-off invention in the 1930s, or if the device gained any type of popularity to protect people from snow. We found no evidence of other photographs depicting similar items, and we were unable to identify the cone mask's original inventor or a patent for it.\n\nSince the 2010s, a picture has permeated corners of the internet purportedly showing two women adorned with large \"blizzard cones\" to protect their faces from a snowstorm. For example, a Reddit post claimed:\n\nThe picture was authentic and accurately captioned (aside from the misspelling of \"Montreal\"). Snopes traced the location of the photograph's original, physical copy to an archive in the Netherlands, where an editor shared what is known about its backstory.\n\nThrough a reverse-image search , Snopes found the photograph has been circulating online since at least 2010 , when it was published by the entertainment website Bored Panda. Since then, dozens of websites, such as Country Living , and social media platforms, including Imgur and X , have shared the picture. Many posts accurately claimed the face masks were said to protect the two individuals from snow , though some falsely asserted that such masks were supposedly used to prevent infection during the 1918 Spanish Flu .\n\nWe found the above image hosted on Fine Art America 's online photograph database, where it was credited to the image-licensing group, Bridgeman Photos . We contacted that agency and were referred to the Dutch foundation, Spaarnestad Photo, which confirmed it was housing the original, physical copy of the picture for the National Archives of the Netherlands.\n\nAfter reviewing the photograph upon Snopes' request, Spaarnestad Image Editor Kim Tieleman told us by email that information regarding the its origins was handwritten on its back. That note said Spaarnestad publishing house first published it in 1939 in the Dutch-illustrated magazine Het Leven, which translates to \"life\" in English. According to Spaarnestad's records, the picture's caption is:\n\nTwo ladies wear plastic face protection against the blizzard and cold in Montreal, Canada 1939.\n\nThere was no information about who took the picture, nor the identities of the women. As of this writing, the photograph's credit was the Nationaal Archief/Collectie Spaarnestad/Het Leven, according to Tieleman.\n\nThe picture's authenticity aside, Snopes was unable to determine whether the cone-shaped mask was a one-off invention in the 1930s, or if the device gained any type of popularity to protect people from snow. We found no evidence of other photographs depicting similar items, and we were unable to identify the cone mask's original inventor, or a patent for it.\n\nFashion and culture historian Deirdre Clemente , an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told Snopes via email that she had never seen or heard of \"such a contraption.\" However, given the popularity of plastic at the time, she said she was not surprised that such an invention existed. \"Tons of innovations in plastics [were produced] in the 1930s and more so into the 1940s, so it's culturally on point with that period,\" Clemente said.\n\nPlastic was invented in 1907 by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland, according to the S cience History Institute in Philadelphia. This, the U.K.'s Science Museum wrote, sparked a \"consumer boom in affordable yet highly desirable products.\""

      "text": "About this rating\n\nSome things are better left in the past.\n\nTake, for example, the wire-enclosed “baby cage” said to have been invented in 1922 as a way to suspend toddlers outside of apartment building windows as a means to give them “proper fresh air.”\n\nPhotographs and videos of the supposed invention have been shared on social media platforms for years and again went viral when a video was shared to X on Oct. 28, 2023. At the time of this publication, the clip had received more than 23.6 million views:\n\nBaby cage invented to get fresh air for toddlers in 1922. pic.twitter.com/Nam2JRShqM\n\n— Historic Vids (@historyinmemes) October 29, 2023\n\nTurns out, this peculiar contraption was indeed real.\n\nSnopes conducted a keyword search of “baby cage patent 1922” and found the invention was genuine. U.S. Patent 1448235 was described as a “Portable Baby Cage” and was filed on July 19, 1922, by Emma Read, a self-described resident of Spokane, Washington, at the time.\n\nThe patent was approved on March 13, 1923, and expired on the same day in 1940. It read, in part:\n\nIt is well known that a great many difficulties arise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint. This is especially true with reference to babies and young children, who at present are being raised in large apartments, as a result of not obtaining the proper fresh air, as well as being outdoors, for such air and exercise.\n\nIn crowded cities, where the houses are closely arranged, and in large apartments, there is no way for proper ventilation. Back and front yards are small, while those living in apartments have no facilities whatever, to permit the children and babies to receive proper fresh air from the outside.\n\nWith these facts in view, it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed. This article of manufacture comprises a housing or cage, wherein the baby or young child together with proper toys may be placed. The baby is enabled to receive fresh air through the screen or wire fabric, and it will be noted that the baby has sufficient room or space for playing with toys…\n\nThe description goes on to explain that “suitable bed clothing” may also be arranged in the cage to allow for proper napping facilities made up with “suitable curtains.”\n\nThe figures below also accompanied the patent , which provided dimensions and construction information for the cage:\n\n(Google Patents)\n\nSnopes also found evidence of the device in a picture hosted by Getty Images taken by photographer Reg Speler on June 23, 1937, with a caption that described the device as a “wire cage attached to the outside of a high tenement block window.” The cages, the caption went on to say, were “distributed to members of the Chelsea Baby Club who have no gardens and live at the top of high buildings.”\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nSnopes has a history of investigating the origins of what appear to be bizarre inventions of the past, including a device that enabled its user to smoke an entire pack of 20 cigarettes at once and plastic cone-shaped face masks to supposedly protect people against snowstorms ."
